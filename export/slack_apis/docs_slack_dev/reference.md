# Reference
Welcome to the new home of Slack developer docs!
We're still building and not all features are available quite yet. Enjoy this peek into the future!
Not ready for the future? Return to the past at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/docs).
Slack apps can utilize a wide range of APIs and platform features to accomplish their tasks. Within this section contains a collection of reference guides for those features, providing a perusable list of parameters for POSTing.
Reference guides are for the experienced, and those who want to jump in at the very deep end.
## Particularly popular pages[​](https://docs.slack.dev/reference#particularly-popular-pages "Direct link to Particularly popular pages")
The most visited reference pages are those for [methods](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods), [events](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events), and [scopes](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes). They're the foundation of all Slack apps.
### Methods[​](https://docs.slack.dev/reference#methods "Direct link to Methods")
We've got quite a bit of API methods! If you're not sure exactly what you're looking for, try filtering by method family to hone in on what looks like a possible solution. Or just start exploring! The Slack Sea stretches far past the horizon.
[Browse methods](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods)
### Events[​](https://docs.slack.dev/reference#events "Direct link to Events")
Slack has always driven communication, and communication goes both ways! Browse our ensemble of events to enlighten and elucidate the comings and goings in your Slack workspace.

### Scopes[​](https://docs.slack.dev/reference#scopes "Direct link to Scopes")
You likely won't find yourself _browsing_ permission scopes — you'll visit their pages when you're informed you need specific scopes — but _understanding_ them is paramount to sculpting a secure slack setup.
