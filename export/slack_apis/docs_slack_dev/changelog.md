## [Release: Slack CLI v3.0.1](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2025/03/19/slack-cli)
March 19, 2025
Slack CLI `v3.0.1` delivers a handful of small improvements thanks to our developer community feedback.
  * We've fixed the `--token` flag and it'll work when combined with the `--app` and `--team` flags.
  * We've fixed the `--app` flag to use the specified app and it'll work when combined with the `--team` flag.
  * We've disabled app manifest caching and overwrite protection for Deno SDK apps that run on Slack because it's not required.
  * We've fixed a bug to support large manifest files by allowing the hooks to parse multi-line boundaries.
  * We've fixed a bug to prevent creating a new app that would overwrite an existing app for a specified team.
  * We've fixed a bug to show an app's team name and team ID, when the app's auth is missing.
  * We've fixed a bug to reset terminal text formatting after prompts, which conflicts with tools such as Python virtual environments.
  * We've improved the performance of resolving the authentication for local, dev apps by reducing the reading of your credentials file.

## [files.upload API method deprecation timeline adjustment](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2025/03/17/files-upload-extension)
March 17, 2025
We want to update you about our [previous announcement](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024-04-a-better-way-to-upload-files-is-here-to-stay) regarding support for the `files.upload` API method. After much consideration and feedback, we have decided to push back the deprecation date to **November 12, 2025**.

## [Slack platform API and tools docs are now in beta](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2025/03/10/api-site-migration-launch copy)
March 10, 2025
Today is the day! As [previously mentioned](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024/12/05/api-site-migration), the Slack platform and developer tools documentation are moving: the shiny new Slack platform documentation is now in beta on [docs.slack.dev](https://docs.slack.dev/), and the developer tools documentation has fully moved to its new home on [tools.slack.dev](https://tools.slack.dev/). The doors are open for our housewarming party ü•≥ so come on in, take a look around, and let us know what you think. Thanks for coming along on this journey with us!

## [Release: Slack CLI v3.0.0](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2025/02/27/slack-cli-release)
February 27, 2025
Version `3.0.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is here, with lots of goodies for you!
  * We renamed the `slack.json` file to `.slack/hooks.json`, and continue to support `slack.json` for existing projects. There is now a warning shown in `--verbose` output to encourage projects to migrate their `slack.json` to `.slack/hooks.json.`
  * We've removed the `invalid_app_directory` error from any commands run in nested project directories, and now search for the required `slack.json` file in the project's configuration. We also now also check for this file at `.slack/hooks.json`.
  * We now cache the last known manifest export; the cache is used to avoid overwriting changes on app settings. If the manifest is changed on app settings since the last update, a confirmation prompt will appear before making another update via the Slack CLI.
  * We've moved the top-level commands you know and love, `slack create` and `slack samples`, to be sub-commands of the `slack project` command (they remain aliased as top-level commands though, so there is no change to the user experience).
  * We've updated the `slack doctor` command to display the `manifest.source` value, which will be either `local` or `remote`.
  * We now officially support Bolt for JavaScript and Bolt for Python in the Slack CLI! üéâ
  * As such, we've updated the `slack create` command with a new create journey that allows you to choose between different types of apps for Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, and Deno.
  * We've also added the `slack init` command, which will initialize an existing Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, or Deno project with Slack CLI support.
  * We fixed a bug to avoid confusion with regular outputs, and now prefix all separate debug logs with a timestamp.
  * We fixed a bug to avoid spinning the spinner when outputting with debug logs, or if styles are removed with the `--no-color` flag.
  * We fixed a bug to now display uninstalled apps in selections when using the `slack collaborators` and `slack manifest` commands.
  * We fixed a bug with confirming trusted templates that are from a Slack GitHub organization.
  * We fixed a bug regarding writing console outputs to activity logs during local runs.
  * We fixed a bug where the Slack CLI would get stuck if one of the goroutines of the `slack run` command encountered an error; we now exit the `slack run` command if this happens.

## [Removing the Slack CLI deno command](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2025/02/27/slack-cli)
February 27, 2025
We [previously](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2023/12/14/slack-cli) mentioned that we had deprecated the `deno` command and removed its listing from the `help` command. We have now removed the `deno` command completely. Developers who were depending on this command should now use the deno executable directly.
We've also removed support for the deprecated, pre-release Deno Slack SDK versions that used `slack.yaml` and `project.ts` files. The Run-on-Slack platform no longer supports the `slack.yaml` file format, and no production projects should be affected. The `project.ts` file was deprecated by the Deno Slack SDK in favor of `manifest.ts` and `manifest.json` files.

## [Slack App Developer Policy updates](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024/12/10/dev-policy-update)
December 10, 2024
On **December 10, 2024** , we updated the [Slack App Developer Policy](https://docs.slack.dev/developer-policy) to add clarity to guidance from our documentation that apps intended for commercial distribution at scale should go through Slack Marketplace review.
While gathering feedback from early customers helps improve your apps, the Slack Marketplace is the right place for apps as they begin to grow. The Slack Marketplace guidelines and our review process help keep the Slack app ecosystem working and customer data secure.
We also clarified existing guidelines about the usage of data collected by your app. Specifically, we are making explicit that the use of data to train an LLM is prohibited.

## [Discontinuing support for legacy custom bots and classic apps](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024-09-legacy-custom-bots-classic-apps-deprecation)
September 30, 2024
We want to let you know about some upcoming changes to support for legacy custom bots and classic apps on the Slack platform.
  * Beginning **March 31, 2025** , we will discontinue support for legacy custom bots. For your integrations to continue working, you must create brand new Slack apps.
  * In ~~**September 2025**~~ **March 2026** , we will discontinue support for classic apps. For your apps to continue working, you will need to [migrate them to Slack apps](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-app-migration/migrating-classic-apps).Any custom bots or classic apps you have built will no longer work after these dates.


It has been over 10 years since we originally launched the Slack Platform. As we [mentioned back in April 2024](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024-04-discontinuing-new-creation-of-classic-slack-apps-and-custom-bots), there are just too many ways to create an app, so we're doing our best to streamline this process. Beginning **March 31, 2025** , we will discontinue support for legacy custom bots. In **March 2026** , we will discontinue support for classic apps. Read on for more details about how this will affect your integrations and apps.

## [The files.upload method is retiring, to be replaced by sequenced Web API methods](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024-04-a-better-way-to-upload-files-is-here-to-stay)
April 9, 2024
The original web API method for uploading files to Slack, [`files.upload`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/files.upload), is being sunset on ~~**March 11, 2025**~~ **November 12, 2025**.
As of **May 16, 2024** , newly-created apps are no longer able to use this API method.
Existing apps & integrations should migrate away from `files.upload` and instead leverage a combination of two APIs: [`files.getUploadURLExternal`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/files.getUploadURLExternal) and [`files.completeUploadExternal`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/files.completeUploadExternal). The use of these two methods is more reliable, especially when uploading large files.
A detailed breakdown of how to use these two API methods is described in our [Uploading files documentation](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/working-with-files#uploading_files).

## [Release: Slack CLI v2.21.0](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024/04/04/slack-cli)
April 4, 2024
Version `2.21.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has sprung!
  * You can now display runtime versions for your application's execution environment using the `doctor` hook. To enjoy the improved `slack doctor` command experience, existing Deno Slack SDK-based apps must have their `deno-slack-hooks` dependency upgraded to the latest version (`v1.3.0`).
  * By relying only on the `get-manifest` hook when attempting to get a manifest rather than checking for a `slack.yaml` file, we now surface any errors that are returned when getting the manifest.
  * We removed the possibility of an error when generating the message boundary hook protocol, and now preserve spacing in logged outputs.
  * We corrected a few typos behind the scenes.

## [Release: Deno Slack SDK v2.9.0](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024/04/01/deno-slack-sdk)
April 1, 2024
In the Deno Slack SDK `v2.9.0` release, the [`invite_user_to_channel`](https://tools.slack.dev/deno-slack-sdk/reference/slack-functions/invite_user_to_channel) built-in function makes the `user_ids` parameter optional rather than required. In addition, a `usergroup_ids` parameter was added, allowing you to invite entire user groups.

March 21, 2024
Versions 2.20.0 and 2.20.1 of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform have landed!
  * We've added a new feature for counting datastore items. Refer to [Counting items in a datastore](https://tools.slack.dev/deno-slack-sdk/guides/using-datastores#count) for more details.
  * We added a new feature to query named datastores from a flag instead of an expression. For example, instead of:


`$ slack datastore get '{"datastore": "todos", "id": "42"}'`
use:
`$ slack datastore get --datastore tasks '{"id": "42"}'`
  * We now include a remediation message for the `not_authed` error that explains how to log in and authorize the Slack CLI.
  * Users can now request app approval at the workspace level on Enterprise Grid.
  * We now include the error code in event payloads to logstash.
  * We fixed a bug to output a link if opening the URL in a browser fails.
  * We fixed a bug to catch missing hooks from a command; the initialization error is now included in the debug outputs. This allows any command to be run from a project directory without immediately posting an error.
  * We fixed a bug to remove ANSI escape sequences from the debug log outputs for an improved grepping experience.
  * We fixed a bug to verify that deprecated flags are properly substituted.
  * We fixed an issue to make our releases run more smoothly. Nothing to see here!

  * The minimum supported PowerShell version as of this release is `v6.0`. If you attempt to use an older version of PowerShell, you may encounter errors reading the Slack Configuration file (`slack.json`) or running the `get hooks` hook.
  * We've added the ability to put, get, and delete items in bulk in a datastore. Refer to [Create or replace items with `put` and `bulkPut`](https://tools.slack.dev/deno-slack-sdk/guides/adding-items-to-a-datastore), [Retrieve items with `get` and `bulkGet`](https://tools.slack.dev/deno-slack-sdk/guides/retrieving-items-from-a-datastore), and [Delete items with `delete` and `bulkDelete`](https://tools.slack.dev/deno-slack-sdk/guides/deleting-items-from-a-datastore), respectively.
  * We've added the ability to import to and export from datastores. Refer to [Datastore commands](https://tools.slack.dev/slack-cli/commands#datastore) for more details.
  * We've added a warning when creating an app from a sample app when the sample app may not have come from a trusted source.
  * You can disable this warning temporarily by running the `slack create` command with the `--force` flag.
  * You can disable this warning permanently by either selecting _don't ask again_ when prompted, or by setting the `trust_unknown_sources` property in your `config.json` file.
  * We've fixed an issue so can now use **CTRL-C** to unhide your cursor when a spinner displays after running `slack deploy`.
  * We've enhanced some error messages and we've improved highlighting matching for help commands.

  * We've updated the _choose a workspace to grant access_ prompt to sort by team name rather than team ID.
  * We've deprecated the `deno` command and removed its listing from the `help` command. The `deno` command is slated to be removed completely in an upcoming release.
  * Endpoints at `api.slack.com` are no longer blocked by a permission error for local apps.
  * We now have better error handling when appending a `(local)` tag to the display name of local apps.

  * We've formatted the system and project configs with indents to make editing easier.
  * We've added a `SLACK_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to the `--config-dir` global flag.

November 16, 2023
Version `2.13.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has landed!
  * We've added an `--all-org-workspace-grants` flag to the `app list` command so you can display all grants instead of only the first three.
  * We've combined `workspace` and `org` language into `team`; as such, we have added a `--team` flag and deprecated the `--workspace` flag. Note that this will not affect the usage of workspace or org when it is necessary to distinguish between them; for example, with the `hermes auth list` and `trigger access` commands.
  * We removed the redirect to the `delete` command when running the `uninstall` command, so you may now only uninstall an app rather than deleting the app entirely along with all of its data.
  * We've updated the CLI installer to align the Deno runtime version with the current version supported by the Slack platform.
  * We've updated all `deno-reverse-string` sample app references to use `deno-started-template` instead.

  * We fixed a bug that caused an error when any property setting flags were provided along with the `--trigger-def` flag.
  * We fixed a bug where descriptions and selected template URLs might be mismatched from the displayed list of samples.

  * We've updated commands requiring validation (e.g. `manifest`, `deploy`, `install`, `triggers create`, and `triggers run`) to catch errors if a connector is not installed, attempt to install any certified apps related to connectors mentioned in the manifest, and then re-validate the manifest.
  * We added new error codes for connectors to aid you in troubleshooting.
  * We added a `--file` flag to the `function distribute` command (renamed to `function access`) so that you can manage access and distributions with a configuration file instead of multiple commands.

  * We've added a [`slack trigger list --type=<string>`](https://tools.slack.dev/slack-cli/commands#trigger-list) flag to only list triggers of a specific type: For example, `slack trigger list --type=shortcut`. We've also supported flag values for `--type=<string>` are `all`, `shortcut`, `event`, `webhook`, `scheduled`, and `external`.
  * We've added flags to provide values for many interactive prompts. Learn more about the flags available by adding `--help` to any command. For example, `slack external-auth add-secret --provider github --secret my-secret-value`.
  * We've updated the `slack app list` command to improve displaying apps you are not authenticated to access. For example, local apps now display a `(local)` label and install status is now shown as `Status: Unknown`.
  * We removed an incorrect timestamp found in the Slack debug log file.
  * The Deno SDK v2.2.0 now displays an error in your editor when you accidentally register duplicate primary keys for `workflow`, `function`, `datastore`, `customType`, `event` or `provider`. This helps prevent unexpected behavior at runtime.

## [It's later already for stars and reminders](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2023-07-its-later-already-for-stars-and-reminders)
July 31, 2023
Starting in March 2023, Slack began rolling out a new collection of features collectively called [**_Save it for Later_**](https://slack.com/help/articles/13453851074067-Save-it-for-Later). It gives you a new **_Later_** section on Slack where things you save for later (with or without a reminder attached to it) are kept.
This new collection of features replaces our previous **_Saved Items_** (also known as _starred items_ , or just _stars_) and **_Reminders_** features.
As part of this new feature roll out, the existing APIs to interface with saved items and reminders have become degraded or useless. There are no direct APIs for **_Save it for Later_** to integrate with. With the current suite of built-in functions, web API methods, events, and triggers offered by Slack it is possible to recreate some (but certainly not all) use cases the impacted APIs supported.
We aim to give ample notice for every platform feature developers would consider a ‚Äúbreaking change.‚Äù We apologize we were unable to provide this information to developers ahead of the **_Save it for Later_** release.

  * The `.github` directory will no longer be included in new projects created from one of our [sample apps](https://github.com/slack-samples).
  * We've updated our support email to `feedback@slack.com`‚Äîemail us for assistance if your app returns an internal [error code](https://tools.slack.dev/slack-cli/errors).
  * The `slack app list` command now returns `Status: Installed` instead of `Status: Unknown` for an installed app.
  * When using the CLI in a non-interactive environment, such as in a CI pipeline, selection prompts will error and suggest a flag alternative to use instead of hanging indefinitely.
  * Trigger generation prompts will be automatically skipped when using `slack run` or `slack deploy` in a non-interactive environment, regardless of how many triggers might exist.
  * We've clarified admin approval requirements when installing to a workspace that has [Admin-Approved Apps](https://tools.slack.dev/deno-slack-sdk/guides/controlling-permissions-for-admins) enabled.
  * Socket connections are now gracefully closed when ending a `slack run` session.
  * Improved typeahead suggestions for the `type` field of `functions` and `datastores` were made in the Deno SDK.

## [Release: Slack CLI v2.5.0](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2023/06/29/slack-cli)
June 29, 2023
Version `2.5.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is hot off the press!
  * We've added a confirmation message if you decide not to delete an app when using the `slack app delete` command.
  * We added a `--hide-triggers` flag to the `slack run` and `slack deploy` commands to prevent retrieving and displaying application triggers.
  * We added a warning to listed trigger info that Slack Connect channels do not support event triggers.
  * We added app collaborators to listed trigger info.
  * We added support to limit paginated results with the `trigger list --limit <n>` command.
  * We added a prompt for whether you would like to include/exclude app collaborators into the named entities list if you set your trigger's ACL to `named_entities`. The `include-app-collaborators` flag will allow you to skip this prompt.
  * We updated the `slack activity` command to support datastore event and error logs. For more information, refer to [logging](https://tools.slack.dev/deno-slack-sdk/guides/logging-function-and-app-behavior).
  * When the `--token` flag is set, background checks for updates will now be automatically disabled.
  * We added support to fall back to a `curl` install of `deno` if `deno upgrade` should fail.
  * The `slack logout` command now accepts the `--workspace` flag.
  * We removed the `--show-triggers` flag from the `slack run` command, as the command now displays all of your app's triggers and their types.

## [Release: Slack CLI v2.4.0](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2023/06/15/slack-cli)
June 15, 2023
Version `2.4.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is now available!
  * We updated the Linux/macOS installation script to support a CLI version param, `-v`.
  * We added a `-d` flag to bypass Deno installation in the Linux/macOS installation script.
  * We updated the Windows installation script to include Alias, Version, SkipDeno, and SkipGit flags.
  * We now suggest Windows users open a new terminal after installation to add the Slack CLI to the user's environment PATH.
  * We bumped minimum required Deno version to `1.31.1`.
  * We replaced the `workspace` command with a new [`app`](https://tools.slack.dev/slack-cli/commands#app) command.
  * We made the `config-dir` global flag visible.
  * We deprecated auth login's `auth` flag in favor of [`token`](https://tools.slack.dev/slack-cli/commands#auth-login).
  * We updated `app list` command to display installation status.

## [Release: Slack CLI v2.3.0](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2023/06/01/slack-cli)
June 1, 2023
Version `2.3.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has arrived!
  * The `external-auth remove` command now allows you to select a token for deletion.
  * The new `external-auth select-auth` command allows you to select a unique auth for each of the workflows in an app. This command is mandatory when using new coded workflows that have a step containing `credentialSource DEVELOPER`; that is, every time a coded workflow is created, this command must be called after the `external-auth add` command.
  * The `slack auth token` and `slack auth revoke` commands allow you to manage service tokens.
  * The `slack auth token` command allows you to get the `slackauthticket` and copy and paste it into your workspace to exchange for the service token. The service token will not be saved to your `credentials.json` file; instead, it is presented in the prompt for you to copy and paste to your CI/CD pipelines. Once you obtained a service token, you can use the `slack login --auth <your-service-token>` command to authorize your Slack CLI. The service token will not conflict with your regular authentication token; you can continue using your regular authentication token within the Slack CLI while using the service token for your CI/CD pipelines.
  * The new global `--token <token>` flag allows you to pass the service token used by requests requiring authentication. For example, to install an app, use: `slack install --token <your-service-token>`. To create a trigger, use: `slack trigger create --token <your-service-token> --app deployed --trigger-def triggers/trigger_def_file.ts`. To deploy an app, use: `slack deploy --token <your-service-token>`
  * We added support for a global `--experiment [name,name,...]` flag.

May 4, 2023
Version `2.2.0` of the developer tools for our beta Slack platform has landed!
  * The `trigger info` command now also shows who has permissions to run the trigger.
  * We added the `--no-color` flag, which removes all ANSI sequences for color as well as emojis, giving you plain text output from the CLI that's perfect for piping to a text file.
  * The `datastore query` command now supports a `cursor` argument to help you paginate your results the way you want.
  * Trigger operations will now let you know when an invalid trigger file is being ignored.
  * We improved error reporting and some help text.

## [2022 changelog entries](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2022/12/31/output)
December 31, 2022
## November[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#november "Direct link to November")
  * We released version `v1.16.4` of the developer tools for our Slack platform beta. We fixed some pipes behind the scenes to prevent future leaks; check out how we are improving the beta platform experience for our community.
  * Three new endpoints for admins to manage role assignments are now available: `admin.roles.listAssignments`, `admin.roles.addAssignments`, and `admin.roles.removeAssignments`. Explore other useful methods for managing your users and workspaces here.
  * We released version `v1.15.0` of the developer tools for our Slack platform beta. It also introduces a breaking change (arriving **January 26th, 2023**) for those making API calls to outgoing domains in their functions.


## October[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#october "Direct link to October")
  * A bevy of new Block Kit input elements await developers soliciting input from users including the often requested combined date and time picker. Collect links with the URL input element or email addresses, numbers, too.
  * We released version `v1.14.0` of the developer tools for our Slack platform beta.
  * We updated the fine print and added default `placeholder` text for the following Block Kit elements: `channels_select`, `conversations_select`, `multi_channels_select`, `multi_users_select`, and `users_select`.
  * At last, member_joined_channel now works as you'd expect for multi-party direct messages (MPIM). Be sure to add the mpim:read scope to receive these events!
  * We're cleaning up some lingering behavior in our legacy Real Time Messaging API. In message events streamed over the RTM API, channel and usergroup mentions will no longer include entity names. Still need entity names? Access them using Web API methods such as `conversation.info` and `usergroups.list`. Alternatively, consider using the Events API, which also supports WebSockets, to receive `message` events.


## September[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#september "Direct link to September")
  * Today we permanently alter the behavior of the retired Web API method `rtm.start`: those still using this method will receive the more reliable but brief response of the `rtm.connect` method. We expect some apps to break but we are here to help!
  * To better accommodate customers at Dreamforce next week, we've moved `rtm.start`'s final retirement date to **September 27th, 2022**. Learn more about the future of `rtm.start` and how it may impact your app.
  * Several new tools for app developers are now available as part of our Slack platform open beta. Developers can ship higher-quality apps and workflows quickly with a streamlined development lifecycle, including secure hosting and data storage in Slack.


## August[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#august "Direct link to August")
  * Keep track of who gets added to DM conversations. You can now monitor the `dm_user_added` audit event with the Audit Logs API.
  * On **September 13th, 2022** , we will provide a preview of the `rtm.start` future behavior. If you still use `rtm.start` to connect to Slack, learn more about when this preview will be happening in your time zone and how it may impact your app.


## July[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#july "Direct link to July")
  * Slack is used by public sector teams and their partners for being faster, better organized, and more secure than email. If you're a government agency, contractor, or just intrigued by how Slack supports government communication, our GovSlack documentation is the place to be!
  * Bring users information and delight in your Slack apps with the video block now available in Block Kit. Read on to learn more on how to embed videos in your app.


## May[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#may "Direct link to May")
  * Be informed about specific changes to users' data. One of three events will now be dispatched alongside the `user_change` event: `user_huddle_changed`, `user_profile_changed`, or `user_status_changed`.
  * The file may be deleted, but the record of the event won't be. You can now monitor `file_deleted` audit events with the Audit Logs API.


## April[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#april "Direct link to April")
  * Messages are how people communicate in Slack, message metadata is how apps communicate with apps! Read on to learn about how to spark more automation with your app throughout Slack.
  * The `team.info` parameter `domain` is now public. Query for your team's information by `domain` only when `team` is null.


## March[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#march "Direct link to March")
  * Mentioning a private channel in a slash command when your app manifest flag `should_escape` is `false` now correctly formats the channel identifier. Previously, the API would return HTML entities (`&lt;` and `&gt;`) that had to be manually converted into their character counterparts.


## February[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#february "Direct link to February")
  * Help users find links, messages, and files germane to a channel's distinctive purpose with the Bookmarks API.
  * The `admin.users.unsupportedVersions.export` API allows you to export users using unsupported software within your workspace. Read on to learn more.


## January[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#january "Direct link to January")
  * Block Kit button elements can now utilize the optional `accessibility_label` field, which allows you to write longer descriptive text for a button. Learn more.
  * The `admin.apps.requests.cancel` method allows admins to cancel app approval requests within a workspace or Enterprise Grid. Learn more.

## [2021 shortform changelog entries](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021/12/31/)
December 31, 2021
## November[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#november "Direct link to November")
  * If you still use `rtm.connect` or `rtm.start` to connect to Slack, you'll notice that all WebSocket URLs now begin with `wss://wss-primary.slack.com`.
  * As previously announced, apps & integrations created after today, **November 30, 2021** , must use `rtm.connect` instead of the deprecated `rtm.start` when connecting to the RTM API.
  * Block elements can now utilize the `focus_on_load` field within Block kit messages, which allows you to pick one specific Block element to auto focus on.
  * The default Slack Connect invitation type when using `conversations.inviteShared` has changed. Invites are now sent to limit the recipient's actions to only sending messages. The new `external_limited` argument can be used to control which invitation type is sent.


## October[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#october "Direct link to October")
  * We're starting to roll out a new, opt-in beta UI that lets you configure and reconfigure apps using manifests. We're also launching new App Manifest APIs to let you create and manage all your apps programmatically.
  * One of our earliest API methods is taking a well-deserved retirement on **September 27, 2022**. For existing apps, `rtm.start` will instead return an equivalent response to `rtm.connect`. Beginning **November 30, 2021** , _newly_ created apps and integrations will only be able to use `rtm.connect`.
  * Introducing two API methods that return information about workspaces previously only available in `rtm.start`: `team.billing.info` and `team.preferences.list`.


## September[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#september "Direct link to September")
  * [Slack Developer Tools](https://sdt.builtbyslack.com) now offers the _Platform Guide_ , an interactive and introductory education experience for developers interested in learning the basics of building a Slack app _within_ a Slack app.
  * Pick a time, any time. The `timepicker` block element is released out of `beta` and available to use in your spiffy apps.
  * The `link_shared` event is changing, bringing unfurls‚Äîallowing users to see what's in a link‚Äîinto the message composer.
  * In the app approval APIs, you may now distinguish the apps built within your organization from those developed externally‚Äîor by Slack‚Äîwith the `developer_type` field.


## August[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#august "Direct link to August")
  * Legacy workspace apps are now completely retired. They won't function anymore and eventually will be completely removed from our databases. If you run into trouble, [please reach out](https://my.slack.com/help/requests/new).
  * The `link_shared` event is changing to bring a little more magic to app unfurls. Read up on the changes, which roll out to free teams on **September 1, 2021**.


## July[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#july "Direct link to July")
  * Modern Sign in with Slack uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) protocol to make signing in with Slack faster and more flexible. Try it today.
  * Refresh your access tokens regularly with token rotation, available for opt-in now.
  * You can now manage Slack Connect directly for your organization using an app. Read up on the Slack Connect APIs.


## June[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#june "Direct link to June")
  * We gave this dusty place a new coat of paint. Enjoy our updates to api.slack.com to help you navigate, discover, and absorb content more easily. Almost everything should be where you‚Äôd expect it.


## May[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#may "Direct link to May")
  * Use manifests to create and manage apps from saveable, shareable, and relatable YAML and JSON. Try out some sample manifests in our new guided tutorials.


## April[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#april "Direct link to April")
  * Apps using classic message attachments have an updated look. Attachment images now have a hover menu and will mostly appear to the right of text. Consider using Block Kit to have more control over how images render.
  * We're teaching old blocks new tricks. Starting **April 20, 2021** `input` blocks are now able to exist within messages, allowing you to gather information more swiftly within conversation.


## March[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#march "Direct link to March")
  * Apps may now broadcast messages to users via direct message without handling unnecessary or unsupported conversation and slash commands. Starting **March 29, 2021** , this feature will be _default_ for all _newly-created_ Slack apps. Get started by visiting the App Home tab of your existing Slack apps.
  * Newly created private channel IDs now always begin with the letter `C`, just like public channel IDs already do. The Conversations API will tell you whether a conversation is private or not with the `is_private` boolean field.
  * Legacy workspace apps, deprecated since October 2018, will officially retire on **August 24, 2021**.


## February[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#february "Direct link to February")
  * The `admin.analytics.getFile` method now returns daily data about conversations in public channels. Members analytics remain available. Explore what's happening on your Enterprise Grid workspaces.
  * Three deprecations take effect today, **February 24,2021**. First, new apps may no longer pass tokens as query parameters. Second, Conversations API methods are now required over their typed counterparts: `channel.*`, `group.*`, `im.*`, and `mpim.*`. Third, event payloads no longer contain full lists of `authed_users` or `authed_teams`‚Äîinstead, use a new method to learn the full list of authorizations an event is visible to. We know keeping up with best practices for Slack apps is a lot to handle‚Äîthank you for allowing us to make the platform better. Keep reading.
  * If your app makes use of user emails, be on the lookout for _relay email addresses_. When users sign into Slack via Apple, their emails may appear as anonymized relay addresses. Relatedly, Sign in with Slack won't work with these users.
  * Now you can decorate your ephemeral messages requesting authorization with Block Kit using `chat.unfurl`.
  * When a user initiates a private channel share via Slack Connect, the channel's ID _changes_. Subscribe to `channel_id_changed` to learn the new IDs for the private channels visible to your app.


## January[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#january "Direct link to January")
  * Updated: Beginning mid-March, links appearing in Block Kit messages shared by apps will unfurl just like other links found in that message.
  * Your app can now count its workflow steps with the help of four new events: `workflow_published`, `workflow_unpublished`, `workflow_deleted`, and `workflow_step_deleted`. Use these events to stay informed on workflows‚Äîfrom unpublished to published and back again‚Äîthat make use of steps powered by your app.
  * Socket Mode supplies your app with events and interactive feature payloads over a dynamic WebSocket URL.

For existing apps, [`rtm.start`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.start) will start behaving exactly like [`rtm.connect`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.connect) on **September 27, 2022**. Beginning November 30, 2021, newly created apps and integrations will only be able to use `rtm.connect`.

## [Goodbye, workspace apps](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021)
January 30, 2021
On **August 24, 2021, legacy workspace apps** were retired. Workspace apps were part of a brief developer preview we elected to not fully release. Since October 2018, existing workspace apps have remained functional but on August 24, 2021 workspace apps will be retired and no longer function.
Please read on if you were the developer, maintainer, administrator, or user of a vintage workspace app.
Don't know if you have a workspace app? Make sure you're signed in to all your workspaces and visit our [**deprecation center**](https://api.slack.com/apps). Each workspace app you own or collaborate on will be listed.

## [2020 shortform changelog entries](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2020/12/31/compilation)
December 31, 2020
## December[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#december "Direct link to December")
  * Submissions to the Slack Marketplace now require Security & Compliance information.
  * Reach a whole new world of workspaces: build an app that can be deployed across an entire Enterprise org.


## November[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#november "Direct link to November")
  * Apps created after **February 24, 2021** will no longer be able to send `token` as a query parameter. All existing apps require no changes.
  * Apps will now be able to unfurl links anywhere in Slack.


## October[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#october "Direct link to October")
  * The admin.analytics.getFile method returns compressed JSON files with workspace member analytics for the day of your choice‚Äînow available for Enterprise.
  * App [modals](https://docs.slack.dev/surfaces/modals) can now be 'popped out' by users, giving them their own resizable, movable window. No app changes are needed, we just wanted to pop in with an update.
  * To simplify time input for users, we added a new time picker element to Block Kit.
  * Block Kit checkboxes and radio buttons are now available to use in messages. Quickly and conversationally collect information from users by including them inline.
  * Gather data from users directly from your App Home‚Äîinput blocks can now be added to Home tabs. Additionally, input blocks can now dispatch `block_actions` payloads when someone interacts with them. Read about the new `dispatch_actions` flag.
  * We refreshed the look of your app's listing in the Slack Marketplace. Among the changes: a _Features_ tab shows your app's entry points‚Äîlike shortcuts and slash commands.


## September[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#september "Direct link to September")
  * We updated our [developer policy and API terms of service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api-updated) to clarify language around export controls and international data transfers.
  * Alongside upcoming changes to the Events API, you'll find numerous new features: a new `authorizations` field delivered with events, a new method for listing installations, a new scope‚Äîeven a new token type for working across an entire organization.
  * Starting **February 24, 2021** , event payloads will no longer contain full lists of `authed_users` or `authed_teams`. Instead, you can call a separate method if you need a full list of parties an event is visible to.
  * On **September 29, 2020** , `view_submission` and `block_actions` payloads will begin including full `state` for messages, modal, and App Home views.
  * On **September 15, 2020** , you'll no longer need to worry about different _global_ and _local_ IDs for Enterprise users. Users will have a single, global ID across an Enterprise org, which may begin with _either_ `U` or `W`.
  * In responses from the `search.messages` method, four fields‚Äî`next`, `next_2`, `previous`, and `previous_2`‚Äîthat sometimes appeared are now deprecated and will no longer appear in responses, beginning **December 3, 2020**. Let us know of your questions or concerns.
  * Get a handle on creating channels, setting preferences, and connecting new workspaces‚Äîall with a single app. Use the APIs for channel management, available to Enterprise Grid organizations.
  * We _slightly_ changed your App Home's appearance by refreshing the default text style and how hint text is displayed. We hope you'll enjoy it.


## August[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#august "Direct link to August")
  * Users may now mute and unmute their conversations with apps [like they can with other channel types](https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages). When a user mutes a conversation with your app, the messages you send are still delivered and a colorful badge will continue to surface in their channel list. However, users will not receive a direct operating system or browser notification on delivery.
  * Slash command invocations will now include an `api_app_id` parameter with your Slack app's ID. This parameter will better assist you in handling commands from multiple applications or environments.


## July[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#july "Direct link to July")
  * New header blocks let you provide stronger delineation between groups of content in your app surfaces. Stay a _head_ of the game by learning how they work.
  * Expand Workflow Builder's capabilities by creating reusable, custom steps that any builder can add to their workflows. Workflow Steps from Apps is now in open beta. What‚Äôs your app‚Äôs next step?
  * Previously, when a user mentioned an app that wasn't party to the conversation, the user could `Invite` the app to the conversation, `Let Them Know`, or `Do Nothing`. The `Let Them Know` button didn't work. We've fixed that mistake by removing the button, and updated our documentation on the `app_mention` event as well.
  * Mark messages unread for users with `conversations.mark`. Bespoke clients and personal utilities should use this method sparingly.
  * The URL where users manage existing installations of Slack apps is changing to [`https://app.slack.com/apps-manage/`](https://app.slack.com/apps-manage/). You might not even notice the difference, but we‚Äôre letting you know just in case.


## June[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#june "Direct link to June")
  * You can now present your app's pricing information in your listing in the Slack Marketplace.
  * With Slack Connect, channels connect multiple workspaces and organizations with ease.
  * A change to `user_change` events: we've fixed a bug where these events dispatched to subscriptions from all workspaces in externally-shared channels. Now, `user_change` events are dispatched only to the home workspace of an externally-shared channel.
  * If you create a _new_ Slack app and use deprecated methods like `channels.*`, `im.*`, `mpim.*`, or `groups.*`, you'll now receive a `method_deprecated` error. _Existing_ apps will receive _warnings_ but still have until **February 24th, 2021** to migrate to the Conversations API.
  * Maintain a membership allowlist for private channels using `admin.conversations.restrictAccess.addGroup`, `admin.conversations.restrictAccess.removeGroup`, & `admin.conversations.restrictAccess.listGroups` methods, now available for Enterprise organizations. _Update_ : These methods were renamed but the old names will continue to work.
  * We recently updated [Block Kit Builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder) with additional preview options and more convenient ways to copy, paste, and dispatch payloads. There's more beauty to it too.


## May[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#may "Direct link to May")
  * The deadline for all Slack apps to use the Conversations API‚Äîinstead of its antecedents‚Äîhas moved from this November to **February 24th, 2021**. Newly created Slack apps won't be able to use `channels.*`, `im.*`, `mpim.*`, or `groups.*` methods beginning **June 10th, 2020**. Warnings will soon be included as part of deprecated responses.
  * Use the Calls API to hook your calls natively into Slack. Catch up on Calls.
  * Legacy tester tokens may no longer be created. Existing tokens may continue to be used, regenerated, or revoked. Tokens left unused for three months or more will be regularly revoked.from our previous announcement.
  * [Complete your IDP groups](https://slack.com/help/articles/115001435788-connect-identity-provider-groups-to-your-enterprise-grid-org) with custom default channels, courtesy of the `admin.usergroups.*` API methods.
  * Starting **July 1st, 2020** , rate limits will apply to all SCIM methods. Please make sure any apps using the SCIM APIs remain within these limits and humbly handle HTTP 429 responses.


## April[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#april "Direct link to April")
  * A more direct route to messaging in response to modals: the new `default_to_current_conversation` field allows your `conversation_select` and `multi_conversation_select` menus to be pre-populate the currently open conversation.
  * The shortcuts button is now available for all Slack workspaces, so we're taking global shortcuts out of beta.
  * Previously, OAuth Redirect URLs could contain anchors (`#`). We've fixed that mistake, and anchors are no longer allowed.
  * Beginning **June 10th, 2020** , all newly created Slack apps will be unable to use the deprecated methods in `channels.*`, `im.*`, `mpim.*`, and `groups.*`. Existing apps have until **February 24th, 2021** to migrate to the Conversations API.
  * Visually highlight destructive actions by using the new `style` parameter in confirmation objects.
  * Give app installers good reason to trust your app: submit security and compliance information to the Slack Marketplace today.
  * SCIM API endpoints now have clear, explicit rate limits.


## March[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#march "Direct link to March")
  * Tune out the noise‚Äîyou can now use filters with conversation lists in select and multi-select menus.and start filtering.
  * Give users clear entry points to your Slack app with Shortcuts. App Actions are now called message shortcuts. They're joined by new global shortcuts that allow users to initiate interactivity from anywhere in Slack.
  * The IDs returned by our APIs have grown longer. They are now up to 11 characters long, and could grow longer in future. Please audit your Slack apps, and verify any assumptions about the length of IDs for users, channels, and other objects.
  * We didn't turn off the `replies` array field found in threaded parent messages on **October 18th, 2019** like we said we would. The new date is **March 31st, 2020**. Please use the `reply_users`, `reply_users_count`, and `latest_reply` fields instead.
  * Fair is fair: radio buttons now support `mrkdwn` formatting, just like checkboxes.


## February[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#february "Direct link to February")
  * New guidelines for Slack Marketplace submissions have arrived to help ready your app for the world.
  * Using two new scopes, your Slack app can adjust its message authorship and post in any public channel.
  * The creation of legacy test tokens is now deprecated and will permanently retire on **May 5th, 2020**.about using Slack apps to build firmly scoped integrations.
  * Starting **February 18, 2020** , unexpected results using the SCIM API when rapidly updating data on the same user or group will become a thing of the past.
  * It's a win for webhooks: you can skip the small stuff and [trigger a workflow with a web request](https://slack.com/help/articles/360041352714).
  * Check another item off your Block Kit wishlist - we've added a checkbox group element to modals and Home tabs for your multiple choice input needs.
  * You can submit information to the Slack Marketplace on your app's privacy policy, data retention, security tests, and compliance with major laws. [Read our blog post on the new Security & Compliance feature, now in open beta](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/building-trust-with-security-conscious-customers-1e85ee856045).


## January[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#january "Direct link to January")
  * Our new emoji APIs allow Enterprise Grid Admins and Owners to add, remove, list, rename, and alias custom emoji across the entire Grid organization. üéâ!
  * Slack apps, with subtler permissions and more intuitive behavior, are now the default when you create an app. Get started by building or migrating.
  * Your app's new Home tab is out of beta. Design a comfortable place for users to get work done using Block Kit Builder and publish them for users using `views.publish`. Get started by diving into the Home tab docs.
  * Give users a key to directly open your Home tab. Read our updated deep-linking guide to see how you can create links to specific tabs in your App Home.
  * We are deprecating all `channels.*`, `groups.*`, `im.*`, and `mpim.*` Web API methods in favor of their Conversations API replacements. Migrate to `conversations.*` as soon as possible, as these deprecated methods will retire on **February 24, 2021**.

## [App unfurls everywhere](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2020/11/01/app-unfurls-everywhere)
November 1, 2020
Until now, it's often been confusing to understand when and where an app may provide customized unfurl behavior for links appearing in conversations. We're gradually rolling out changes that will make this behavior consistent and easily understood. Read on to learn more.

## [No more tokens in querystrings for newly created apps](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2020-11-no-more-tokens-in-querystrings-for-newly-created-apps)
November 1, 2020
Tokens may no longer be passed in the query string for apps created after Feb 24, 2021
On **February 24, 2021** , we will stop allowing _newly created_ Slack apps to send requests to [Web API methods](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods) with access tokens presented in a URL query string. Instead, apps must send tokens in the `Authorization` HTTP header or alternatively as a URL-encoded POST body parameter.
Existing apps will be allowed to continue sending their tokens in the `token` query string parameter, though we recommend all apps to use authorization headers whenever possible.

## [Events API truncate authed users](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2020-09-15-events-api-truncate-authed-users)
September 15, 2020
Your app's [events](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events)‚Äîreceived from the [Events API](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/)‚Äîare changing.
Event payloads will no longer contain a full list of `authed_users` or `authed_teams`. These two fields will be deprecated. There'll be a new, compact field called `authorizations` to replace them‚Äî**but** `authorizations` will only contain _at most one_ person or workspace that the event is visible to.
If you need a _full_ list of all the parties an event is visible to, you'll [call the `apps.event.authorizations.list` method](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#what).
The new, streamlined shape of events allows Slack to deliver them faster.
These changes to the Events API will take place on **February 24, 2021**. You'll be able to **opt in** to them earlier, on September 29, 2020, by going to your [app settings](https://api.slack.com/apps) and selecting the checkbox under **Event Subscription**.
In order to get ready for the changes to authorizations, you can use the [`apps.event.authorizations.list`](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#what) method **even without opting in** to the new shape of events, starting September 29, 2020.
Read on for more details on [what's changing](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#what) and [how to prepare](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#how).

September 1, 2020
If you rely or want to rely on stateful Block Kit views, we have some exciting news for you. The payloads for [`view_submission`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/interaction-payloads/view-interactions-payload#view_submission) and [`block_actions`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/interaction-payloads/block_actions-payload) will have some new additions.

## [Legacy test token creation to retire](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2020-02-legacy-test-token-creation-to-retire)
February 1, 2020
Legacy tester tokens may no longer be created.
We're deprecating [legacy test tokens](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-custom-integrations/legacy-custom-integrations-tokens) and will disallow the creation of new test tokens beginning **May 5th, 2020**.
We launched Slack apps over four years ago as a replacement to the number of ways one could obtain overly-permissive tokens to integrate with Slack.
If you or a software product you author relies on test token creation, you will need to migrate to using Slack apps with specifically named scopes instead.
Existing tester tokens will continue functioning but tokens left unused are subject to periodic revocation.

## [Deprecating antecedents to the conversations API](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2020-01-deprecating-antecedents-to-the-conversations-api)
January 7, 2020
We released the [Conversations API](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/using-the-conversations-api) in September 2017 as a one-size-fits-all replacement for a variety of APIs used to read and write information about channels, private channels, direct messages, and multi-party direct messages.
Today we are announcing the deprecation of the methods that preceded the Conversations API (`channels.*`, `groups.*`, `im.*`, & `mpim.*`). On ~~November 25th, 2020~~ **February 24th, 2021** these methods will retire and cease functioning.
If users expect your app to work in channels of any kind, you'll want to verify you're using the Conversations API for all channel types.
The final date for existing apps and custom integrations is now February 24th, 2021
We'll stop allowing _newly created_ Slack apps to use these deprecated APIs beginning June 10th, 2020.
All `channels.*`, `groups.*`, `im.*`, & `mpim.*` methods will return [deprecation warnings](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#warnings) beginning June 10th, 2020.
**We resolutely recommend migrating to the Conversations API immediately.**

## [2019 shortform changelog entries](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2019/12/31/compilation)
December 31, 2019
## December[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#december "Direct link to December")
  * We didn't set out to produce almost 700 pages of documentation but you can search it all now on api.slack.com/search.
  * Slack apps may now be submitted to the Slack Marketplace.
  * Place useful limits on multi-select menus using the new `max_selected_items` parameter.


## November[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#november "Direct link to November")
  * Your App home is going mobile ‚Äî you can now interact with an app's Home tab from iOS and Android clients. We recently published a new App home tutorial to help you build, or you can read the Home tab docs.
  * Help users make informed decisions when considering your app by listing the languages it's fluent in and any pricing model that applies to it. You can provide this info as part of the Slack Marketplace submission process.
  * You can now use Block Kit radio buttons in modals, in addition to Home tabs.
  * We're removing the misleading and undocumented `guest_channels` field from user profile objects belonging to guest users. The `users.conversations` method is an accurate way to query the channels a guest user belongs to.
  * Slack has but one REST API, the SCIM API, and it's now fully standards-compliant with SCIM 1.1 when using the HTTP PATCH method to update user records.


## October[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#october "Direct link to October")
  * Your apps have always needed a better home, right in Slack. Now apps with bot users can use Block Kit with a new surface called the _Home tab_. Learn how to use this new space to provide users with a persistent place for dynamic experiences.
  * Radio is alive and well in Block Kit. Obtain a singular choice from users using our new radio button elements.
  * Craft a workspace faster than a cup of coffee and fill it with users, admins, and owners. Check out the APIs for creating workspaces and managing users, now available for Enterprise Grid organizations.
  * Slack apps can act independently of a user token. Build a bot user powered by only the specific permissions it needs. Check out our open beta for newly created Slack apps.


## September[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#september "Direct link to September")
  * Announcing new pastures for Block Kit beyond messaging: trigger dynamic modal interfaces to provide linked user experiences invoked from messages, actions, or slash commands.
  * Embrace procrastination ‚Äî allow users choose from multiple options in interactive workflows. Use new multi-select menus in all your Block Kit surfaces.
  * This autumn or soon thereafter, users will begin editing messages using a WYSIWYG (_what you see is what you get_) interface. When they do, their posted messages will appear slightly different throughout our APIs.


## August[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#august "Direct link to August")
  * Two new events, `channel_shared` and `channel_unshared`, now notify your app when a channel is shared or unshared.
  * A single admin app can now approve or restrict other app installs across an entire Enterprise Grid org. Get a little meta, and a lot more time-efficient, with the APIs for app management.
  * As previously announced, `pins.add` will stop accepting file and file comment IDs beginning **August 22, 2019**. Similarly, `reactions.add` will no longer allow file and file comment parameters. Nowadays, apps and users pin & react to messages _about_ files instead.
  * On **March 4, 2020** , we'll require all apps, custom integrations, bots, and users communicating with Slack to use TLS version `1.2` or higher. There will be a 24 hour test deprecation on **February 19th, 2020**. Read more details on why and how to upgrade.
  * Channel names have grown up: instead of a maximum length of 21 characters, channel names may now feature a full 80 character label.


## July[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#july "Direct link to July")
  * Host files wherever you please, while you add, update, remove, share, and unfurl them in Slack. Read up on the new Remote Files API.
  * Enterprise Grid admins may now use the `admin.users.session.reset` method to wipe a user session, logging out a user whose device may have been stolen or compromised.about the new method, as well as the new scope required to use it.


## June[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#june "Direct link to June")
  * Your app may now encounter channels shared between workspaces on Enterprise Grid. As a result, it's even more important to use the Conversations API methods to safely handle channels both shared and unshared.
  * Using the SCIM API's `GET /Users` or `/Groups` methods? Their `count` parameters will no longer accept values above `1000` beginning **August 30, 2019**.
  * As announced previously, the `dnd.teamInfo` method now _requires_ the `users` parameter. An explicit list of `users` helps you, and us, avoid slow API calls.


## May[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#may "Direct link to May")
  * As previously announced, the `files.comments.add` and `files.comments.edit` methods are retiring today. Also, files may no longer be pinned to channels. The `pins.add` method will no longer accept files or file comments beginning **August 22, 2019**.
  * Better built-ins. Nifty type hints. Easier RTM event handling. Build for the future with the [new Python SDK V2.0.0](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient), lovingly crafted with Python 3.
  * Want to build a Slack app with JavaScript? Use the [Bolt](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt) framework. Effortlessly _bolt_ listeners onto events. Minimize boilerplate to post messages, forming a beautiful _bolt_ of conversational cloth. Leverage TypeScript to autocomplete code faster than a lighting _bolt_. Go ahead, bolt toward [Bolt](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt).


## April[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#april "Direct link to April")
  * Parent messages in a thread will no longer explicitly list their replies. Instead of a large `replies` array containing threaded message replies, we'll provide a lighter-weight list of `reply_users`, plus a `reply_users_count` and the `latest_reply` message. These new fields are already available. We'll remove the `replies` array on **March 31st, 2020**.
  * Make your app a better listener with the `app_home_opened` event. When a user enters a conversation with your app, you can trigger a friendly onboarding flow, a whimsical welcome message, or a deep-dive into dialog.
  * Retrieve all active incidents, rather than just the most recent one, using version 2.0.0 of the Slack Status API.
  * Buttons in message blocks have gained some color. Use the new `style` field to visually compel and alert users.
  * We're returning a more descriptive `limit_required` error when you call `users.list` or `channels.list` for teams containing tens of thousands of responses. To avoid the peril of errors entirely, use pagination.


## March[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#march "Direct link to March")
  * Taking a novel approach to pagination, the v5 release of our [Slack SDK for Node.js](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/releases) supports Node v8 LTS and above. It also splits the client into three separately installable packages optimized for speed and bundle size. Work with other languages or frameworks? Browse other tools built for you.
  * When querying `dnd.teamInfo`, the `users` argument is required beginning **June 3, 2019**. Future-proof your app by explicitly listing which `users` you wish to see _Do Not Disturb_ settings for.
  * Harness a hint of time travel for your app. Schedule messages for delivery at the time of your choosing.
  * We're starting to enforce (more firmly) the 5GB file upload limit for workspaces on a Free plan. Some API endpoints will yield tombstoned files with the content redacted.


## February[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#february "Direct link to February")
  * We're retiring the `files.comments.add` and `files.comments.edit` methods on **May 22nd, 2019**.
  * We're loosening up limits on dialogs. You can use five extra elements (ten total) and lovingly label them with longer lengths of letters.
  * When your exacting maths require the precise number of members party to a particular conversation, use the new `include_num_members` parameter with `conversations.info`.
  * Build better messages with Block Kit, a set of building blocks for messages and vast, interactive workflows. And, build messages better with Block Kit Builder.
  * We're limiting legacy tester tokens by revoking them when they're left unused for several months. As a pleasant counterpoint, our method testers let you bring your own token now.


## January[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#january "Direct link to January")
  * Apps endure, even when their installing user leaves the team‚Äî _as long as_ the app doesn't perform actions on behalf of the installing user. This new behavior rolls out to free, paid, and Enterprise Grid teams over the next week.
  * Conversation objects associated with shared channels now feature a `conversation_host_id` field, indicating the workspace or Enterprise Grid organization that "hosts" the shared channel.
  * We're erasing the `shares` attribute from "shared channel" conversation objects. In methods like `conversations.history` and the Events and RTM APIs, enjoy a lighter-weight list of the `shared_team_ids` representing the teams across which the conversation is shared.

## [What you see is what you get and more and less](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2019/09/01/what-they-see-is-what-you-get-and-more-and-less)
September 1, 2019
This autumn, Slack will make what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editing available to users.
Once we release WYSIWYG editing, the `text` field found in message objects your app encounters will become an _approximation_ of a user's more richly formatted message.
To capture a message's full nuance and vibrancy, your app may look to the new `blocks` attribute included with such messages.

## [Deprecate early TLS versions](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2019-07-deprecate-early-tls-versions)

When your app, custom integration, or bot communicates with Slack via HTTP, it uses [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (Transport Layer Security) to ensure data privacy and integrity.
There are multiple major versions of TLS, including `v1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, and `1.3`. Versions `1.0` and `1.1` are deprecated and should no longer be used.
On **March 4, 2020** , we'll require all communications with Slack to use TLS version `1.2` or greater.
All TLS connections must use the [SNI extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). Lastly, TLS connections must support at least one of the following supported cipher suites:
  * `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`
  * `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
  * `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA`
  * `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA`
  * `AES128-GCM-SHA256`
  * `AES256-GCM-SHA384`


Using TLS version `1.2` or greater makes Slack safer for everyone.

## [Have SCIM, will paginate](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2019-06-have-scim-will-paginate)
June 1, 2019
We're modernizing the [GET /Users](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scim-api/scim-api-1.1#get_users) and [GET /Groups](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scim-api/scim-api-1.1#get_groups) methods of our [SCIM user management API](https://docs.slack.dev/admins/scim-api) by putting a more reasonable upper bound on results served per page.
The [SCIM spec](http://www.simplecloud.info/specs/draft-scim-api-01.html#query-resources) allows for pagination and these methods have long supported it, but we've accepted higher `count` values in the past.
The changes described below are effective ~~July 8th, 2019~~ **August 30th, 2019**.

## [Wild West no more (for file limits, at least)](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2019-03-wild-west-for-files-no-more)
March 1, 2019
Free teams feature a 5 GB limit on file uploads. However, as in the Wild Wild West of yore, the limit wasn't enforced. As of March 5, 2019, we're starting to enforce the file upload limit more firmly: only the last 5 GB of files will be visible to Free teams. In APIs that return file uploads, older files beyond the limit will be shown as 'tombstoned,' with redacted information and a `"hidden_by_limit"` field.

## [Cemented fate for file comments](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2019/02/01/cemented-fate-for-file-comments)
February 1, 2019
File threads superseded file comments in [July 2018](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018-05-file-threads-soon-tread). On **May 22nd, 2019** , we will permanently retire the `files.comments.add` and `files.comments.edit` API methods.
Vintage file comments remain accessible and deletable with `files.comments.get` and `file.comments.delete`.

## [2018 shortform changelog entries](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018/12/31/compilation)
December 31, 2018
## December[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#december "Direct link to December")
  * Post replies in a thread with incoming webhooks: the `thread_ts` parameter now puts your webhook reply in its proper place.
  * The data structure of messages received from our APIs will change with the [launch of Block Kit](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/catching-up-on-all-things-spec-851f8c5136fb#df8b) early next year. In return you'll be able to add newer, clearer visual components to make your app's messages magnificent. Even if you aren't using it, your apps may be affected by the additions.


## November[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#november "Direct link to November")
  * Apps may now restrict Web API requests to as many as _10_ IP address ranges.
  * The developer preview for workspace apps has ended. We're taking the components of workspace apps and breaking them apart: applying them in phases to _existing_ as well as new apps. [Read more about the motivation behind ending the preview](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/an-important-update-on-workspace-apps-aabc9e42a98b).


## September[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#september "Direct link to September")
  * As public channels become private, they now retain their original channel ID. Legacy methods like `groups.*` and `channels.*` don't support these transitional channel types and Conversations API methods must be used instead.
  * Whatever flavor of workspace token you're using, you can now expect the same `invalid_auth` error code when the token is invalid. You'll receive this error whether the token is expired, revoked, or just plain wrong. Use our OAuth 2.0-based token refresh system to refresh expired tokens safely.


## August[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#august "Direct link to August")
  * Workspace apps may now continuously rotate shorter-lived tokens without downtime. Our OAuth 2.0-based token refresh system is strongly recommended for all workspace apps. Expiring and rotating tokens is required for all distributed workspace apps.
  * Clear clever custom statuses like clockwork. Apps can add expiration dates when setting custom statuses for people.
  * We're postponing planned changes around scope requirements for app and bot access to email addresses. The new date is in autumn, on **October 16th, 2018**.
  * Dialogs now follow a separation of callback and state. Read more about the new `state` parameter and how it differs from `callback_id`.
  * Verifying requests from Slack just got easier: [our Node Interactive Messages SDK](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages), [Node Events API SDK](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-events-api), and [Python Events API SDK](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api) now verify request signatures automatically.
  * _"40k ought to be enough characters for any message."_ - Slack Platform Gatekeepers. Messages are now limited to 40,000 characters.
  * Your workspace app can use the new `apps.uninstall` method to uninstall itself from a single workspace, revoking all tokens associated with it. To revoke a workspace token _without_ uninstalling the app, use `auth.revoke`.
  * It's official: workspace apps can reach out to and converse with anyone using the new `conversations.app_home:create` scope. No more fumbling with conversation IDs or different methods: just plug the user's ID into `chat.postMessage` and go.
  * If your workspace app posts ghostly messages with `chat.postEphemeral`, you may have noticed a `no_permission` error thrown instead of `channel_not_found` when your app isn't a member of the target conversation. Turns out we actually _could_ find the channel after all.
  * We updated our [Slack App Developer Policy and API Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api-updated) to provide more detailed guidance, but we have not made material changes. The new policy is effective **August 31, 2018**. Together, we keep Slack a safe, private and secure platform for work.


## July[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#july "Direct link to July")
  * Pagination rules the nation and the Slack API. These methods newly support cursors: `files.info`, `groups.list`, `im.list`, `mpim.list`, `reactions.list`, and `stars.list`. For apps created after **August 7, 2018** , results will be returned in perfect, piecemeal pages _by default_.
  * With [Slack developer tools](https://sdt.builtbyslack.com) you can now quickly look up documentation, investigate the structure of messages, and more, all inside of Slack.
  * Commenting on files is now just like replying to a message.
  * HTTP requests originating from Slack now support Mutual TLS. Use Mutual TLS to attain the highest level of confidence that requests from Slack are, in fact, authentic. Read more.
  * Get ready to lend users a hand and start working on their behalf. Now workspace apps can ask for permission to read & write personalized settings like reminders, custom status, and profile data.
  * Our recently launched message actions are now available for use in all Enterprise Grid workspaces and any Shared Channels within them.


## June[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#june "Direct link to June")
  * Confidently verify a request originates from Slack by validating our new request signatures. The signing process replaces the use of verification tokens, now deprecated.
  * We expect file threads to arrive after **July 19, 2018**. Do you manage a Slack app relying heavily on files or file comments? Join our _pilot program_ and prepare your app for file threads ahead of the transition.
  * Learn when private channels are deleted with the new `group_deleted` event, now available for the Events and RTM APIs.
  * The Conversations API now supports workspace apps, using three simplified scopes: `conversations:history`, `conversations:read`, and `conversations:write`. We recommend upgrading your apps in developer preview to the Conversations API as soon as possible.


## May[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#may "Direct link to May")
  * Beginning **October 16, 2018** the `users:read.email` scope is _required_ to retrieve the `email` field from user profiles while using _user_ or _workspace_ tokens. Consult our previous announcements on this topic from 2016 and 2017 for migration tips and some historical perspective.
  * Adding contextual actions lets users send specific messages to your app at will. [Here are some amazing things](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/introducing-actions-a-simple-shortcut-attached-to-every-slack-message-e2404414ece) our partners do with actions. This blueprint demonstrates the ineffable _synergy_ of using actions and dialogs together.
  * We're compiling a [humble library of JSON schema](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs/tree/master/events-api) about the Events API into a kind of [open specification](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs) called [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/).
  * Newly-issued bot user token strings are a little longer than before. Building for the ages? Plan for token strings containing up to 255 characters.
  * Apps participating in our developer preview using the Events API will need to subscribe to `message.app_home` events for a focused feed of messages between your app and the people who interface with them through the _app home_. These messages aren't delivered to `message.im` subscriptions now.
  * File threads, a replacement for file comments, is on the way!


## April[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#april "Direct link to April")
  * Measure drop off and send helpful follow ups when users cancel dialogs with these opt-in cancellation notifications.
  * Have a bot user token you don't need or want to use anymore? Now you can use `xoxb-` tokens with `auth.revoke`.
  * Your workspace token-based apps in _developer preview_ must now request the `files:write` scope to upload & manage files instead of `files:write:user`. Existing access grants are backfilled. Know your read & write rights.
  * Working with workspace token-based apps as part of our preview? Please start using `oauth.access` instead of `oauth.token` during installation.
  * Some bots are users too. Now you can find a bot user's `user_id` with `bots.info`.
  * Enhance your dialogs with dynamic form elements "borrowed" from message menus.
  * Rediscover the conversations you're party to with `users.conversations`.


## March[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#march "Direct link to March")
  * We corrected and clarified the behavior of `users.profile.set` to only allow _admins_ of paid teams to update email address profile fields.
  * We added a `type` field to the requests dispatched to your _Options Load URL_ , used in message menus and‚Äî well, it doesn't work anywhere else _yet_ but we'll have a dialog about that one day...
  * This significant upgrade to the [Slack SDK for Node.js](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/releases/tag/v4.0.0) modernizes one of the most widely-used Javascript libraries on our platform with strong typing, more intuitive method signatures, and comfortingly predictable release cycles. It also sheds its aging DataStore, which has not evolved in tandem with the realities of building apps for today's workspaces. Learn more about upgrading in [our announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/noteworthy-updates-to-the-slack-node-sdk-d3f77389d6c7).
  * We are continuing to decrease the maximum number of results returned by `members` arrays returned in `channels.*` and `rtm.start`, with the limit currently set to 500 results. `conversations.members` provides paginated access instead. Read this announcement for detail.
  * Web API methods will be enhanced with tiered rate limiting beginning **March 7, 2018** , with most methods gaining greater limits than ever before.
  * Now you can follow up after users submit your dialogs. Use the new `response_url` attached to any `dialog_submission` to send messages after submission.


## February[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#february "Direct link to February")
  * Now users can respond to dialog textarea elements with up to 3,000 riveting, carefully-chosen characters.
  * Events API rate limiting has matured, now allowing apps up to 30,000 event deliveries per workspace per hour. Having trouble keeping up? Event deliveries will only be disabled when apps drop below a 5% successful response rate.
  * The `users.setActive` method was recently rendered irrelevant by our efforts to modernize our message servers. Use `users.setPresence` and/or connect via RTM to proclaim a user's presence instead. We'll remove this no-op method entirely on **May 8, 2018**.


## January[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#january "Direct link to January")
  * Catch up on recent changes to presence in the RTM and Web APIs and changes to come, including the deprecation of `users.list`'s `presence` parameter.
  * Having trouble connecting to the RTM API lately? WebSocket URIs may contain querystring parameters & some libraries don't like that. Find out more.
  * Workspace token apps in _developer preview_ now must request the `chat:write` scope to post messages. Existing access grants are backfilled.
  * Active listening made easier: Subscribe to `app_mention` events to exclusively receive messages mentioning your app or bot.
  * Now shared channels can be made private and the implications are well worth considering, especially if assuming channel IDs beginning with C are public.

## [A bric a brac of broadcasts built with blocks](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018/12/01/a-bric-a-brac-of-broadcasts-built-with-blocks)
December 1, 2018
The data structure that represents a message now contains additional new fields on top of all [the existing fields](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message) your app may be currently expecting. The new structure took effect on February 13, 2019.
These changes come with Block Kit‚Äîa new set of components for Slack apps that can be combined to create visually rich and compellingly interactive messages. You can read more about Block Kit [below](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#block-preview).
Even if you aren't using Block Kit to compose messages, its launch still affects the data structure of messages _received_ via our APIs, so read on to learn how to prepare your apps.

## [Workspace token rotation](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018/08/01/workspace-token-rotation)
August 1, 2018
Workspace apps are deprecated
[Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021).
Workspace apps use an **access token** to represent all the permissions granted to your app by a workspace.
Workspace tokens are so potent and powerful that apps should take great care to keep them safe and secret. We're releasing a OAuth 2.0-based token expiration and rotation system that will make workspace tokens short-lived while providing your app a secure means to refresh tokens as needed.
For more detail on the ins and outs of token rotation, check out our [full documentation](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021).

## [Conversations APIs and scopes for workspace apps](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018/06/01/conversations-apis-and-scopes-for-workspace-apps)
June 1, 2018
Workspace apps can now use a simplified interface for working with the [Conversations API methods](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/using-the-conversations-api). A workspace app can request three new scopes: `conversations:history`, `conversations:read`, and `conversations:write`. These three scopes cast an umbrella of permission over each different conversation type: channels, DMs, or anything in between.
Workspace apps are deprecated
[Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021).
These new scopes make it even easier to use [Conversations API methods](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/using-the-conversations-api), allowing apps to negotiate permissions for, and then interact with, all types of conversations at once.

## [App home events for workspace apps](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018/05/01/app-home-events-for-workspace-apps)
May 1, 2018
Workspace apps are deprecated
[Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021).
We've added the [`message.app_home`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message.app_home) event for workspace apps building on our [developer preview](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021).
If you subscribe to [`message.im`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message.im) events to receive messages between users and your app in the special kinds of 1:1 conversations had in your _app homes_ , you **must** add a subscription to `message.app_home` to continue receiving and acting on those messages.
Workspace apps grant apps a dedicated space within Slack where members can interact directly‚Äî we call it your **_App Home_**. Apps can use this space for personal notifications, onboarding information, and other helpful features.

## [File threads soon tread](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018-05-file-threads-soon-tread)
May 1, 2018
We're fixing file comments and in the process we're phasing out some related API methods and events.
File comments look like messages in a channel but they _aren't_. They travel with files, wherever shared, disrupting conversation at inopportune moments.
We started to gradually roll out _file threads_ on July 23, 2018. Sharing a file with a channel will now create an actual message instead of something that looked convincingly _like_ a message. People and bots may reply to that message as they would any other message. You can even upload files _into_ threads.

## [OAuth flow changes for workspace token preview apps](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018/04/01/oauth-flow-changes-for-workspace-token-preview-apps)
April 1, 2018
Workspace apps are deprecated
[Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021).
We're simplifying the installation process for workspace apps.
Now workspace apps can and should use the [`oauth.access`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/oauth.access) method instead of `oauth.token` during the verification code exchange phase of app installation via OAuth 2.0.
When used with workspace apps, the response for `oauth.access` morphs into a response similar to that of `oauth.token`, but with a few improvements detailed [below](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#token_acess).
Now [`oauth.access`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/oauth.access) may be used by workspace apps instead of `oauth.token`, simplifying a common hurdle when getting started with workspace apps.
Finally, we're replacing `apps.permissions.info` with `apps.permissions.scopes.list` and `apps.permissions.resources.list`.

## [Scoping file rights for writes in workspace token apps](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018/04/01/scoping-file-rights-for-writes-in-workspace-token-apps)
April 1, 2018
Workspace apps are deprecated
[Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021).
We're simplifying some permission scopes as part of the workspace apps developer preview.
Beginning today, workspace apps must request [`files:write`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes/files.write) instead of `files:write:user` during installation or when seeking elevated permissions.
Now `files:write` represents your app's ability to upload and manage files.
Experiencing _d√©j√† vu_? This is just like [that time](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018-01-the-right-chat-write-for-workspace-token-apps) we did this for `chat:write`.

## [Truncating really long messages](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018-truncating-really-long-messages)
April 1, 2018
We're tidying up the character limits on the `text` field of posted messages.
Beginning April 25th, 2018, we truncated messages sent to Slack that are longer than 500,000 characters. As of July 12, 2018, we truncate at 100,000 characters.
Over the [next several weeks](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#when), we slowly lowered the allowed character count.
On **August 12, 2018** we started truncating messages containing more than **40,000 characters**.

## [Great rate limits](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018/03/01/great-rate-limits)
March 1, 2018
Until now, the [rate limits](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/rate-limits) governing the [Slack Web API](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/) have been vague, even sometimes undefined.
This week we are rolling out an evolved rate limiting system granting a greater number of requests to most [methods](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods) and sets responsible defaults in the few cases where limits were more mysterious or unenforced.
We've granted a brief grace period to a small number of apps & integrations to adjust.

## [Presence present and future](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018-01-presence-present-and-future)
January 30, 2018
The RTM API's `presence_change` event is now **only** available via [presence subscriptions](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/user-presence-and-status#subscriptions) and [`rtm.start`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.start) **no longer** includes user presence status in its response.
We incrementally announced these changes in [June](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-06-batch-presence-and-presence-subscriptions) and [October](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-10-making-rtm-presence-subscription-only) 2017.
Today, we're _also_ announcing the **deprecation** of the optional `presence` parameter in [`users.list`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.list). Beginning **September 26th, 2018** , the `presence` parameter and corresponding fields will no longer be available from `users.list`.
Developers utilizing user presence state in their applications and integrations should review this guide to the many recent and coming changes to presence.
Update: [`users.setActive`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.setActive) is also deprecated due to underlying functionality not being available in our most modern message servers.

January 11, 2018
We now serve query string parameters on the `wss://` WebSocket URIs produced by [`rtm.connect`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.connect) and [`rtm.start`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.start).
While the specification for WebSockets explicitly allows query string parameters, some third party libraries not fully implementing the spec may handle these parameters incorrectly, stripping them off and invalidating your attempts to open a connection.

Though we didn't anticipate issues sending query strings in websocket URIs, some libraries and frameworks may need tinkering with.
  * Use [**Slack API in Go**](https://github.com/nlopes/slack) AKA `github.com/nlopes/slack`? Update to the latest version of this Golang project to resolve connection issues. A [recent commit](https://github.com/nlopes/slack/pull/217) merged with master fixes websocket URI handling.

## [The right chat:write for workspace token apps](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018-01-the-right-chat-write-for-workspace-token-apps)
January 11, 2018
Workspace apps are deprecated
[Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-01-workspace-apps-retiring-the-platform-graveyard-in-aug-2021).
Legacy workspace apps are deprecated and will retire in August 2021. Learn more.
We're simplifying some permission scopes as part of the workspace apps developer preview.
Beginning today, workspace apps must request [`chat:write`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes/chat.write) instead of `chat:write:user` during installation or when seeking elevated permissions.
Now `chat:write` represents your app's ability to post messages in the channels and contexts granted to it.

## [2017 shortform changelog entries](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017/12/31/compilation)
December 31, 2017
## December[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#december "Direct link to December")
  * For those moments when your app knows a user's email address but hasn't met them on Slack yet: now apps with `users:read.email` can use `users.lookupByEmail` and skip wading through `users.list`.
  * Turn your links into buttons by adding link buttons to your messages.
  * Storyboard, mock, and play make believe with these useful design templates starring your favorite platform features.


## November[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#november "Direct link to November")
  * Use `chat.getPermalink` to easily exchange a message `ts` for a permalink URL.
  * Why couldn't bot users use `bots.info`? We don't know but now they can too.
  * Help people get back to work by deep linking to your Slack app or directly to a channel.
  * When a workspace migrates to Enterprise Grid, existing users are given a second _global_ user ID. Now you can bulk convert those with `migration.exchange` and turn off your app's translation layer, living the dream of one user ID per user.
  * Do what you like with this OpenAPI 2.0 specification of our Web API. Most methods now contain more helpful response examples. More specs and coverage on the way. [Read on](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/standard-practice-slack-web-openapi-spec-daaad18c7f8) about our API spec.


## October[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#october "Direct link to October")
  * Send JSON when posting to Web API write methods. Gone are the days of perfunctory errors when sending lovingly crafted JSON to `chat.postMessage` and other methods.
  * We broadened support for presenting your tokens as a "bearer token" in `Authorization` HTTP headers with the Web API.
  * We removed the `latest`, `unread_count`, and `unread_count_display` fields from limited contexts of the new Conversations API. They weren't really supposed to be there. You won't find them spuriously lurking in the shadows again. We don't anticipate any issues but let us know if you find any.
  * The `members` array found in many API methods is now truncated. We continue to lower the maximum results returned. Please use `conversations.members` to manage memberships instead.
  * Scheduled changes and feature retirements to the Slack platform are now easier to find in our forward-looking calendar of upcoming changes.
  * The RTM API's `presence_change` event requires `presence_sub` subscriptions beginning **November 15, 2017**.


## September[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#september "Direct link to September")
  * Ask users for more structured form-based information with Dialogs.
  * Now you can customize your app's experience by the locale and language preferred by users, channels, and other conversational constructs. Start practicing your Klingon. üññ
  * Shared Channels let Slack apps collaborate with users across different organizations.
  * The Conversations API is a collection of more than 15 Web API methods normalizing the way apps deal with channels, direct messages, and more. Never rely on the first character of a channel ID again.
  * The role of `@username` is changing on the platform but we're making the transition as backwards-compatible as possible.
  * We are clarifying two terms encountered throughout Slack, _"team"_ (the people you _talk_ to in Slack) and _"workspace"_ (the place you do work). You'll find many _team_ references updated to _workspace_ across Slack and API documentation. With artifacts like the `team` object, field, and parameters scattered through the platform, you'll often still encounter `team` while reading and programming.
  * No more sad panda üêº because we fixed it ‚Äî Now the outgoing webhook response payload includes a `thread_ts` attribute so you know if the message is triggered in a thread!


## August[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#august "Direct link to August")
  * Batten down the hatches! Further secure your internal integrations by restricting token use of Web API methods to specific IP addresses you trust: IP allowlisting is here.
  * Improve your custom unfurling flows with enhancements to authenticated unfurls and `chat.unfurl`.
  * No longer the sole domain of slash commands and interactive messages, now apps can emit their own ghostly ephemeral messages with `chat.postEphemeral`.
  * _Temporary rollback_ : We've reinstated access to the `email` attribute for bot and user tokens. On **August 1, 2017** we proceeded with limiting email access to user tokens with `users:read.email`.
  * Our developer preview for a new kind of Slack app based on workspace tokens is _open_. Learn how to work with workspace tokens and about our new Permissions API. Our [announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/looking-to-the-future-of-apps-in-slack-c2633df0bcb7) covers the story behind the token.
  * With so many token types decorating our platform, this guide to token types has become a necessity.
  * Now we allow you to learn more about OAuth permission scopes and methods, events, and token types each supports with this helpful OAuth scope library.


## July[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#july "Direct link to July")
  * Shuttle Slack app installers to the installation flow more swiftly from the Slack Marketplace with a Direct Install URL.
  * Our little changelog has its own RSS feed now.
  * Buried somewhere in this RTM announcement, we told you about the `latest` field departing from channel objects returned in the long `rtm.start` preamble. Those fields are gone. Turns out we also removed `unread_count_display` and `unread_count` too. If you're suffering from a sense of loss over these unread count fields, please drop us a line. You can still find them in `conversations.info`.
  * Your app has a home in Slack. [Read all about it](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/giving-apps-a-new-home-in-slack-daa2ba3a75ed)!
  * Teams now have the option to limit Slack app installation _only_ to apps listed in the Slack Marketplace.
  * We're introducing a unified cursor-based pagination model to many of our Web API methods beginning with but one: now you can drink from `users.list` one delicious sip at a time.


## June[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#june "Direct link to June")
  * Get an event when more members join your User Group or when ‚Äî uh-oh, it loses members with `subteam_members_changed`.
  * Do you work with `presence_change` events in the RTM API? Learn about new ways to subscribe and consolidate presence events here.
  * We've compiled a collection of Best Practices around building fantastic Slack app user experiences. Your users will be stoked!
  * We've turned a light on for you and your development team: App Blueprints are like recipes for building the internal integrations your team needs to succeed.
  * We've corrected a long-standing bug where user or `@channel`-type mentions in back-tick fenced code blocks would trigger notifications. They won't now.
  * We've made very minor improvements to our OAuth-based installation process. You may notice a shifted pixel here and there but no app-facing functionality has changed.
  * Just like subscribing to your app's own newsletter: App Events tell the story of your app's lifecycle. Learn when your app is uninstalled with `app_uninstalled`, or when user and bot tokens are revoked with `tokens_revoked`. Pause and resume activity when teams migrate to Enterprise Grid with `grid_migration_started` and `grid_migration_finished`.


## May[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#may "Direct link to May")
  * We _undocumented_ the mysterious `user_id_mapping_old_to_new` field described in the Enterprise Grid documentation. It doesn't actually exist and never has, oops!
  * Slackbot wants to help spread the word about your cool Slack app. Add a little HTML to your site and we'll suggest your app when your links are mentioned.
  * You'll soon see fewer `message.channel_join` and `message.channel_leave` message subtype events in the Events API and RTM API. Instead, you'll find these new refreshingly direct and informative events: `member_joined_channel` and `member_left_channel`.


## April[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#april "Direct link to April")
  * The old `channels.list` API method has a new parameter: `exclude_members`. Some teams are so big and some channels have so many members that listing them all in a single API response along with every other channel is just outright impractical. Cull unneeded data easily accessed with `conversations.info` by excluding `members` fields.
  * We'd like you to stop using `rtm.start` and start using `rtm.connect` instead. `rtm.connect` boots quickly and works well with the most gigantic teams and enterprises of the galaxy.
  * It's spring cleaning time for email. We're winding down the grandfathering introduced for apps using `users:read` created before **January 4th, 2017**. After **August 1st, 2017** your apps must request `users:read.email` to gain that access. See this post for more detail. This retirement has been delayed with no date yet rescheduled.
  * Observe the custom status of team members with `users.profile.get`. Update a user's custom status with `users.profile.set`.
  * More ways to make messages interactive than before: introducing message menus. Define your options statically, dynamically, even _personally_ ‚Äî or use our handy conversation, channel, and user pickers. Don't forget your field guide.


## March[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#march "Direct link to March")
  * As with the humans operating them, user objects change over time. With the new `updated` field, decisively learn last time a user object transformed. Look for it in methods including (but not limited to) `users.list` and `users.info`. It's an integer value depicting [seconds since the epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
  * We're introducing new, multimedia ways for bots and apps to express themselves in the Slack Marketplace. Follow our new guidelines to make a great impression with potential installers.
  * Provide users posting links with all the context and interactivity they need, right in Slack. Introducing Slack app unfurling. Here's the [announcement](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/ebcad7c531f0#.dp0ehltqg)!
  * Beginning **March 9, 2017** , events transmitted via the Events API will include `event_id` and `event_time` fields. `event_id` is globally unique across all teams while the `event_time` is when the event dispatched, in integer-based epoch time. Use these fields as you like, but there's nothing you need to do to prepare for this eventuality.
  * We made it easier to create and manage your Slack apps. And if you're building internal integrations for your own team, there's a better way to install your app without worrying about the OAuths. Check it out.
  * Looking for custom integrations? They're documented as legacy now. They still work like you're used to but we'd prefer you built your internal integrations as part of a Slack app instead.


## February[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#february "Direct link to February")
  * Minor field changes coming to `channels.history` file messages and `skype` user profile fields.


## January[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#january "Direct link to January")
  * You have the tools and the talent ‚Äî now you have the opportunity: develop for Slack Enterprise Grid. Here's [the announcement](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/148185a609f2) for the suits.
  * Now your app can read, write, and party with message threads. Rolling out to teams over the next few days, message threads are a perfect place to tuck your wonderful workflows. Here's [our announcement](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/cd272a42924f#.tn0geq5bf).
  * This new year's resolution is a minor slash command revolution: a backwards-compatible, familiar, and decisive means to resolve user IDs, channel IDs, and links from references in slash command invocations.

## [Keeping up with the JSONs](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-10-keeping-up-with-the-jsons)
October 1, 2017
Incoming webhooks can do it. [Slash commands](https://docs.slack.dev/interactivity/implementing-slash-commands) and [interactive messages](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-messaging/legacy-making-messages-interactive) speak it fluently. The message builder knows no other format. But, until now, [`chat.postMessage`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/chat.postMessage) stubbornly refused to understand your messages composed in impeccable JSON.
Finally, Slack allows you to send JSON to [a wide selection](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#methods) of write-based [Web API](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/) methods. Additionally, now you can better separate concerns when presenting your credentials to Slack.

## [Making RTM presence subscription only](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-10-making-rtm-presence-subscription-only)
October 1, 2017
RTM API Presence is now only available via subscription.
As of January 2018, [`presence_change`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/presence_change) events are not dispatched without [_presence subscriptions_](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/user-presence-and-status) established with [`presence_sub`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/presence_sub). Relatedly, current user presence status is no longer communicated in [`rtm.start`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.start). [Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018-01-presence-present-and-future).
**Beginning November 15, 2017, the RTM API's[`presence_sub`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/presence_change) event will be available via presence subscription only.**
[Back in June](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-06-batch-presence-and-presence-subscriptions), we introduced new ways to track user presence and the [`presence_change`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/presence_change) event in the [RTM API](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-rtm-api).
Dispatching presence events for all users in a workspace is an expensive operation for Slack. A flood of presence events from large workspaces can also disrupt your app's ability to process more useful, timely messages.
By subscribing only to the presence events your app needs to provide presence-dependent functionality, you can reduce unnecessary websocket traffic.

## [The members array is being truncated](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017/10/01/members-array-truncating)
October 1, 2017
Arrays of `members` found in API methods will become truncated beginning December 1, 2017.
The maximum number of results found in `members` continues to decrease regularly
As of March 2018, the limit is set to 500 results. Use [`conversations.members`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/conversations.members) for channels with large memberships.
Initially, Slack will limit `members` to the first 1,500 users and then gradually lower the number of users returned. You should expect API methods will cease returning `members` entirely at some point in the future. If you rely on the `members` array, you should instead begin using [`conversations.members`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/conversations.members) for a full list of members.
As Slack teams continue to grow in size, returning the full `members` array in these methods is no longer practical or performant, for the Slack APIs or developers. The `conversations.members` method will allow you to request a list of members at a time that makes sense for your app and should keep these method calls nice and zippy.

## [Locale locale locale](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017/09/01/locale-locale-locale)
September 1, 2017
Slack now supports multiple languages, and your app or integration can too.
Add a `locale` in [user](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/objects/user-object) and [conversation](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/objects/conversation-object) by using the `include_locale=true` parameter when requesting a bundle of Web API methods supporting it.
The locale field is a string containing a [IETF language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), such as `en-US`. `fr-FR`, `es-ES`, or `de-DE`, and other future values.
We now support `include_locale` on these methods. Opt-in to receive a `locale` field in user profiles or the `locale` of a conversation.
  * [`conversations.info`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/conversations.info)
  * [`rtm.start`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.start)
  * [`users.info`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.info)
  * [`users.list`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.list)


If you don't include the parameter, no `locale` will be provided. It's opt-in.
You'll also see locale information changes in related user profile change events in the RTM and Events APIs.

## [The one about usernames](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-09-the-one-about-usernames)
September 1, 2017
Slack is phasing out the `@username` artifact in favor of the more expressive and flexible concept of _display names_.
Handles, aliases, call-signs, and usernames ‚Äî in chat, they all repersent the same concept: a way for an individual or entity to indicate a preferred identification noun, in whichever way is appropriate to the apparatus at work.
Users will be even better equipped to present their preferred nomenclature while giving organizations the option to work primarily with so-called _real_ names as suits "the suits."
The transition should be technically "backwards compatible" to you, the developer. But the social ramifications, changes in user behavior, and treatments given in Slack clients will inevitably alter the way your apps approach interpreting, storing, and utilizing the now _deprecated_ `name` field.
As fellow developers, we know you'll have some feelings about the sunset of `@username` considering its historical significance in computing, networking, and digital identity. From mainframes to UNIX to BBSes to IRC, maybe you've used the same name for what seems like centuries.
Fly your freak, geek, or mild-mannered flag proudly by just setting your _display name_ to your preferred `@username`.

## [Batch presence and presence subscriptions](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-06-batch-presence-and-presence-subscriptions)
June 1, 2017
RTM API Presence is now only available via subscription.
As of January 2018, [`presence_change`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/presence_change) events are not dispatched without [_presence subscriptions_](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/web-api/user-presence-and-status) established with [`presence_sub`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/presence_sub). Relatedly, current user presence status is no longer communicated in [`rtm.start`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.start). [Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2018-01-presence-present-and-future).
If you've been developing on Slack for awhile you may have noticed a continued theme with updates we make to the platform and APIs: larger teams and evolving use cases mean previous ways of enumerating collections of data become unwieldy and even problematic.
In this exciting edition of the changelog, I'd like to introduce you to new ways to work with `presence_change` events in the [RTM API](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-rtm-api).
**If you don't work with the RTM API or don't utilize`presence_change` events, there's very little of value for you in this changelog.**

## [Rethinking channel entrance and exit events and messages](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017/05/01/rethinking-channel-entrance-and-exit-events-and-messages)
May 1, 2017
We've long delivered a [message subtype event](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message) to everyone in a channel as members come and go.
As a _message_ , its main purpose is to communicate facts to _users_ but it was never a very good vehicle for communicating these facts to bots and applications.
We're introducing new, more frugal logic behind when Slack dispatches [`message.channel_join`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message/channel_join) and [`message.channel_leave`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message/channel_leave) [message subtype](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message) events in the [RTM API](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-rtm-api) and [Events API](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/).
If you've relied on these events for programmatic notice when members leave or join a channel, we've got new, strongly structured signals for you to subscribe to and consume instead, [`member_joined_channel`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/member_joined_channel) and [`member_left_channel`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/member_left_channel).

## [Narrowing email access](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access)
April 1, 2017
Accessing email addresses
The [`users:read.email`](/reference/scopes/users.read.email OAuth scope is now required to access the `email` field in user objects returned by the [`users.list`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.list) and [`users.info`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.info) web API methods. [`users:read`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes/users.read) is no longer a sufficient scope for this data field. [Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access).
Back in November 2016, we [introduced](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2016-11-10-addressing-email-addresses) the `users:read.email` OAuth permission scope, allowing more explicit access to email addresses.
To help developers with the transition, we automatically grandfathered apps asking for `users:read` created before January 4th, 2017.
We'd like to complete this transition and remove this grandfathering **entirely** on ~~August 21, 2018~~ ~~October 16, 2018~~ ~~a _future date_ we'll one day announce~~.
Apps created before January 4th, 2017 with user tokens granted only the `users:read` scope will no longer receive the `email` field in user objects.
If you want access to email addresses, you'll need the new [OAuth permission scope](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-authentication/legacy-oauth-scopes), `users:read.email`. It provides an explicit, additive way to request access to team email addresses.
Additionally, the `bot` scope will no longer grant [bot user](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-bot-users) tokens access to email addresses. Bot users must utilize a user token and the `users:read.email` scope instead.
Don't need access to email address but do need access to user data? `users:read` should be all you need.

## [Start using RTM connect and stop using RTM start](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017/04/01/start-using-rtm-connect-and-stop-using-rtm-start)
April 1, 2017
** _Update 2017-07-12_** : As promised, the `latest` fields within `rtm.start`'s channel objects are no longer returned. Additionally, the `unread_count` and `unread_count_display` channel fields are also _missing_ , though they can still be found in [`conversations.info`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/conversations.info).
[`rtm.start`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.start) began life as a broker and bootstrap to Websocket connections established by Slack's desktop and mobile clients. Whenever our clients needed more information to establish state, those fields would get stuffed into the cacophony that is `rtm.start`'s opening salvos.
As team sizes and feature complexity has grown, delivering this immense quantity of information about nearly every user, channel, and conversation on a team has become more difficult to compute, consume, or continue.
It is in this spirit we offer a friendlier alternative in [`rtm.connect`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.connect), a method born with the sole purpose of reserving a websocket connection and providing your application its URL.
[`rtm.start`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.start) must evolve to continue functioning well for all teams and apps. We strongly recommend using [`rtm.connect`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/rtm.connect) to establish your connections alongside [Web API methods](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods) to build your app's understanding of the users, channels, and conversations within a team.
One such change coming to `rtm.start` is the elimination of the `latest` attribute assigned to each `channel` in its response.
On **July 11, 2017** we'll no longer return these `latest` fields. If your app needs a channel's latest timestamp value, use [`conversations.info`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/conversations.info) to retrieve it instead.
You can test this future behavior in `rtm.start` today by providing the `no_latest=1` parameter.

## [Minor field changes](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-02-minor-field-changes)
February 1, 2017
It's almost spring and we're doing a little cleaning early this year.
Ever notice how the `username` field of a file object in `channels.history` or [`file_shared`](/reference/events/file_shared event isn't like typical username fields and contains a bunch of markup usually reserved only for message text?
And why is there a top-level `skype` field in user profile objects when _really_ , shouldn't that be a custom field?
Well, _we've_ noticed. And so...

  * Now everyone's bot is present and accounted for. Events API-only bots can toggle online presence by visiting their app management command center. Details worth catching up on: bot user presence.
  * We made it so Slack apps have a profile within Slack like humans do ‚Äî Here's an [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/SlackAPI/status/809823694683918337).


## November[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#november "Direct link to November")
  * Let's extend a warm welcome to new `app_id` fields now appearing in our APIs. `app_id` is now found in `rtm.start` & `bots.info`. You'll also find `app_id` in the `bot_added` & `bot_changed` events. What's an `app_id`? It's the alphanumeric string found in the URL bar while managing your Slack apps.
  * We've added a new OAuth permission scope called `users:read.email`. Apps created after **January 4th, 2017** will need to request this additional scope to gain access to team member `email` fields when using `users.list` and `users.info`. Existing Slack apps with `users:read` are automatically grandfathered to include these fields.
  * Now you'll find links to practical tutorials and thoughtful articles displayed beside relevant documentation found here on api.slack.com. Discover new articles or browse them by topic in our new Tutorials hub. Written something great? Tell us about it!
  * Our developer relations team has renewed Slack's adoption of key open source tooling: Slack Developer Kits. Discover our Python & node.js SDKs in their new home on our community index.


## October[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#october "Direct link to October")
  * Your elaborate Slack apps are no longer shackled to but just one team member. Now you can invite other team members to be App Collaborators to share in the fun and responsibility. Here's what our web log has to say about it: [Build together with App Collaborators](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/8162e31800f1)


## September[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#september "Direct link to September")
  * We will soon add an additional `response_metadata` node to our JSON responses; we'll put warnings there first and other useful stuff later. More details are available.
  * Newly issued OAuth token strings are longer than they were before, as we informed you about last month. Let us know if this vexes you.
  * Now you can use the `users.profile:write` OAuth permission scope to reset and upload profile images using `users.deletePhoto` and `users.setPhoto`.
  * We've dramatically improved the process of submitting a Slack App for inclusion in our Slack Marketplace. You'll find a helpful, interactive checklist when first submitting your app. When you're ready to iterate further, you can create a secondary beta application. If a core piece of your app's functionality changes (like requesting new OAuth permission scopes), we'll happily review your app again. [Read all about it](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/c3234239731#.vwlgf4mwd) on the platform blog.


## August[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#august "Direct link to August")
  * Ever needed to send a user to Slack directly from your app? Deep link and make native Slack clients part of your app's workflow: Open key teams, channels, and conversations. Or, defer to search results using the slack:// URI scheme.
  * The character length of token strings is getting longer. Find out how long they'll get and how to future-proof yourself for changes in the future.
  * You may encounter an occasional user ID beginning with the letter `W`. We've released a new version of [node-slack-sdk](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-sdk) to correct a related bug.
  * Introducing the Events API, a new way for Slack apps to receive event types previously available only to the real time messaging API. Subscribe to the events your app needs and have them delivered right to your server as they happen. Build a bot or event-driven app without worrying about websockets, and scale it like a web app. [Read more](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/d7120470983f) about the Events API in our blog post, [_Subscribe to the Events API_](https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/d7120470983f).


## July[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#july "Direct link to July")
  * Until now, it's been easy to accidentally send messages flush with hundreds of message attachments. We've begun limiting the number of message attachments per message to 100. For approaches like `chat.postMessage`, incoming webhooks, and `chat.update`, and `response_urls` you will receive a `too_many_attachments` error. Unfortunately, we are unable to serve you an error when sending messages as part of a slash command or message buttons invocation response.
  * If you're interested in listing your Slack app in the Slack Marketplace, you'll want to review our new Slack Marketplace Agreement and consider our Security Review Process. Find these and other policies in our new Slack App developer policy hub.
  * We've corrected a bug where incoming webhooks could post messages in "#general" even 1. if that channel restricts posts and 2. the user owning the webhook was not allowed to post there. This new behavior will only prevent recently created webhooks from posting to restricted "#general" channels, so if your old webhooks are relying on this quirk, they'll be fine for now.


## June[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#june "Direct link to June")
  * Now your applications can read and write defined team profile fields for individual team members. The `users.profile:write` scope allows you to edit fields with `users.profile.set`. The `users.profile:read` scope empowers you to discover available fields with `team.profile.get` and retrieve user profiles with `users.profile.get`.
  * Slack apps can now add action-invoking interactive buttons to messages, allowing you to simplify workflows and encourage users to take decisive action from within Slack.
  * For better readability, syntax highlighting has been added to code blocks throughout our documentation.
  * We've corrected the behavior of `stars.list` so that it only returns stars belonging to the owner of the presented token. The `user` parameter may still be used if the provided user ID belongs to the user utilizing the token.
  * Team administrators may now use tokens with the `admin` scope to request information about the billable status of team members using the team.billableInfo API method.
  * Now that `bot_id` appears in the real-time messaging API and Web API, you need a better way to look up bot users. Use the new `bots.info` method to query bot/application information by ID. It requires the `users:read` scope.


## May[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#may "Direct link to May")
  * Additional real time messaging API events will begin including the `event_ts` timestamp field later this summer. Find out what to expect.
  * Now you can put down a footer on your message attachments. Use the `footer`, `footer_icon`, and `ts` fields to tie content across time and space.
  * For the few of you out there using outdated tokens, we've made some changes to authorship behavior when using `chat.postMessage`.
  * Error conditions in incoming webhooks are due for an improvement. Read all about how blanket HTTP 500s will become more fine-grained, purposeful error conditions. Shipped on **June 16, 2016**.
  * Recently introduced bugs in our iOS & Android apps cause message attachment fields marked as "short" to wrongly render _long_ anyway. Our fixes may take a couple weeks to reach each platform.
  * Sign team members into your website, service, or application with Sign in with Slack, based on the same OAuth 2.0 flow used by the Add to Slack button. Read more about it in this [announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/introducing-sign-in-with-slack-290949e1c3f5#.hghansb1o).
  * We've added two new API methods: `users.identity` works with Sign in with Slack and `auth.revoke` revokes hallway privileges for access tokens. Actually, it revokes the whole token.
  * For those who don't know why they should build on Slack: <https://slack.com/developers>


## April[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#april "Direct link to April")
  * Bot user tokens may now use `files.info` to look up information about files they have access to by virtue of their channel memberships. Also, very helpful for adapting to upcoming file events changes.
  * Manage your Slack apps joyously with our updated app edit pages.
  * File events are changing in the real time messaging API beginning **May 16th, 2016**. The `files.info` method is soon to be used by bot users.
  * As [previously announced](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/api-update-new-field-in-api-responses-d23076ea2ef3), we've added a `bot_id` field to relevant API responses. Let us know if you run into any issues.
  * We released a family of API methods to create and manage reminders. Meet reminders.list, reminders.info, reminders.add, reminders.delete, and reminders.complete.
  * We fixed an unfortunate bug where a team member could inadvertently uninstall a whole Slack App from their team by removing a single incoming webhook associated with that instance of the app.
  * Find out what we're building! [Announcing](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177) our Platform Roadmap.
  * Another way to keep up with the Slack Platform: Install the API News App to receive occasional, important notifications about the platform.
  * Your bot users author their own messages, now they can edit them too. Bot user tokens may now use `chat.update`, like humans do.


## March[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#march "Direct link to March")
  * Now `chat.postMessage` will better intuit your intent when you don't explicitly specify the `as_user` parameter. Let us know if we're guessing wrong!
  * One day soon our Web API will warn you when something is only slightly wrong with your requests. Read all about [API warnings](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/well-wishes-and-warnings-in-the-web-api-489456837220).
  * _Be welcoming. Be kind. Look out for each other._ This is the Code of Conduct for the Slack Developer community.
  * Now bot users can use methods requiring the `dnd:read` scope, like `dnd.info` and `dnd.teamInfo`. Your bots'll be more polite than a protocol droid!
  * Craft your fancy messages in real time with the new Message Builder!
  * Users can now rename Bot Users they've installed as Slack Apps. More naming, more claiming. No more terrible twos.
  * We _finally_ updated the [slackhq/slack-api-docs](https://github.com/slackhq/slack-api-docs) repository, reflecting recently introduced and quite ancient documentation updates and new features.


## February[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#february "Direct link to February")
  * `reaction_added` & `reaction_removed` events now include an `item_user` field indicating the user that created the original content everyone's raving about.
  * Published this changelog you're reading right now. So that you can know about all this stuff. Tell your friends.
  * New Web API methods: share files publicly with `files.sharedPublicURL` or make them private again with `files.revokePublicURL`.
  * `files.comments.add`, `files.comments.edit`, and `files.comments.delete` are now available to bot users.
  * Quickly find the right tools for your project with our new listing of often-used open source libraries.
  * The handy test token generator previously found in the Web API documentation now stands proud with its very own page.
  * Need help? We have some tips for you.
  * api.slack.com's sidebar is now better organized by topic.


## January[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#january "Direct link to January")
  * As of **January 4th, 2016** , authorization headers are now required for most Web API requests involving file URLs. See this doc and [blog post](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/important-changes-to-files-in-the-web-api-eb38f2a9c1e7) for more information.
  * `url` and `url_download` are no longer part of file objects
  * Enjoy our evolving collection of Frequently Asked Questions (and answers!)
  * Responses to Incoming Webhook requests now include `channel_id`
  * Make sure you're ready before submitting your Slack App for review by following this Slack app checklist.
  * Incoming Webhooks documentation updated to better bait best practices and discourage fishy formatting behavior.
  * The file object documentation now includes a list of possible file types.

## [Addressing email addresses](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2016-11-10-addressing-email-addresses)
November 10, 2016
Accessing email addresses
The [`users:read.email`](/reference/scopes/users.read.email OAuth scope is now required to access the `email` field in user objects returned by the [`users.list`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.list) and [`users.info`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.info) web API methods. [`users:read`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes/users.read) is no longer a sufficient scope for this data field. [Learn more](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access).
This original plan has been updated
Grandfathering is no longer in effect. Please see [this post from April 2017](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access) for more information.
We've added a new [OAuth permission scope](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-authentication/legacy-oauth-scopes) called `users:read.email` and it provides a new explicit, additive way to request access to team email addresses. If you don't need email addresses but do need other user info, `users:read` is still all you need.
Apps created before **January 4th, 2017** are grandfathered and will continue behaving in a backwards-compatible way. Apps created after that date must request the new `users:read.email` scope. Regardless of creation date, we encourage all apps to migrate to this new scope.

## [Response metadata is on the way](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2016/09/28/response-metadata-is-on-the-way)
September 28, 2016
We want to tell you even more about your API requests. On November 1st we'll begin including a `response_metadata` field in HTTP API responses.
At first it will include a `warnings` array, just as the top-level JSON response does today. API warnings are great example of the kind of information we want to communicate in this response metadata, so please forgive our duplication.
Later we'll include a `messages` array. It will include human-readable descriptions of errors or warnings generated by your request.

## [Token lengthening](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2016/08/23/token-lengthening)
August 23, 2016
Beginning next month, newly issued tokens will be longer than previously issued tokens.
Until now, we haven't documented the string length of tokens, so we hope you've used caution when preparing your token storage apparatuses.

## [More event timestamps in the RTM API](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2016/05/31/more-events-timestamps-in-rtm-api)
May 31, 2016
Within the next few weeks, we'll add `event_ts` timestamp fields to additional [streamed events](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events) you receive in the [real-time messaging API](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-rtm-api).
## What are these fields for?[‚Äã](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog#what-are-these-fields-for "Direct link to What are these fields for?")
The `event_ts` field differs from the `ts` timestamp fields you already receive with most events. The `ts` field is associated with the object or transition the event is describing while the `event_ts` attribute refers to the streamed event.
The `ts` field is like a date scrawled on a letter contained within an envelope ‚Äî it's part of the message itself.
The `event_ts` is like a postmark stamped on the envelope as part of the postal process, an artifact of the workflow used to deliver the message to the intended recipient.
As with `ts`, `event_ts` is expressed in a kind of "[epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)", contained within a string and including fractions of seconds.
An example `event_ts` timestamp value of `"1361482916.000004"`, could be converted to UTC as `2013-02-21 21:41:56 UTC`.
`event_ts` is especially useful when noting your real time progress through a channel's history.

## [Authorship changing for older tokens](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2016/05/19/authorship-changing-for-older-tokens)
May 19, 2016
Long ago, a small number of enterprising users and developers scoured through client-side code to discover embedded user tokens and began posting messages and performing other skunkworks operations with them. We applaud this adventurous spirit!
Today we take the first step in retiring usage of these antiquated tokens, by changing their behavior when used to post messages through [`chat.postMessage`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/chat.postMessage).

## [Changes to errors for incoming webhooks](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2016-05-17-changes-to-errors-for-incoming-webhooks)
May 17, 2016
Today, [incoming webhooks](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks) either work or they don't. Usually they do, but when they don't, you get a somewhat nasty umbrella HTTP 500 error, even when error conditions were due to something well-understood, like malformed requests or non-existent destination channels.
We will diversify our responses to include commonly-interpreted HTTP status codes. For most developers using incoming webhooks, this change will not require additional effort. Most HTTP clients readily consume and predictably react with these status codes.

## [RTM API file events payload change](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2016/04/26/file-events-in-the-rtm-api)
April 26, 2016
If you parse events referencing [files](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/objects/file-object) in the [real-time messaging API](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-rtm-api), you may have noticed we send a sometimes comically large packet of information when streaming nearly anything related to a file.
To improve performance and provide a better user experience, we're reducing the payload of most file-related events in the RTM API to include only the file's ID. You'll need to use the [`files.info`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/files.info) API method to retrieve additional information about files.
These changes will roll out gradually beginning May 16th, 2016 ‚Äî read below to understand how this change may effect you, especially if you work with bot users.
[Bot users](https://docs.slack.dev/legacy/legacy-bot-users) will gain comparable capabilities, allowing bot user tokens to work with `files.info` based on the channel memberships and related capabilities granted to them.
