# Developer support
Welcome to the new home of Slack developer docs!
We're still building and not all features are available quite yet. Enjoy this peek into the future!
Not ready for the future? Return to the past at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/docs).
Whether you’re working on an app for the [Slack Marketplace](https://docs.slack.dev/slack-marketplace), developing your own [workflow-based app](https://docs.slack.dev/workflows), or setting up a no-code solution with [Workflow Builder](https://docs.slack.dev/workflows), you'll find yourself in good company, from all of us here at Slack and the wider community of developers working with the platform.
## Slack Platform Support[​](https://docs.slack.dev/developer-support#platform-support "Direct link to Slack Platform Support")
Our [FAQ](https://docs.slack.dev/faq) answers many common questions about using our APIs. If you can't find your answer there, you can reach our dedicated Developer Support team at feedback@slack.com or through our [handy support system](https://my.slack.com/help/requests/new).
If you have questions about our Slack [tools](https://tools.slack.dev) and SDKs, you'll want to check out the [Slack API GitHub org](https://github.com/slackapi). Our Developer Relations team actively responds to bug reports and enhancement suggestions related to these topics here. If your question falls outside of this, please use our [support system](https://my.slack.com/help/requests/new).
