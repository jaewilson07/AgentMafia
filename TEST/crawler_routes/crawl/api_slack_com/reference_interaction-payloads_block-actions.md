# Reference: Block actions payloads
A `block_actions` payload is received when a user interacts with a [Block Kit interactive component](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements).
Read our guide to [handling payloads from user interactions](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads) to learn how your app should process and respond to these payloads.
## Timing of payload dispatch [](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/block-actions#payload_timing)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/block-actions#payload_timing)
Different [interactive components](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements) will cause an interaction payload to be sent at different moments:
Component | Payload sent  
---|---  
[`button`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#button) | When the button is clicked.  
[`checkboxes`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#checkboxes) | When a checkbox is ticked or unticked.  
[`datepicker`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#datepicker) | When a date is chosen and the date picker closes.  
[`multi_*_select`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#multi_select) | Each time an item is chosen from the multi-select menu.  
[`overflow`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#overflow) | When an item from the overflow menu is clicked.  
[`plain_text_input`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#input) | Determined by the `dispatch_action_config` field in the element.  
[`radio`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#radio) | When the selected radio in a group of radio buttons is changed.  
[`*_select`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#select) | When an item is chosen from the select menu.  
[`rich_text_input`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#rich_text_input) | Determined by the `dispatch_action_config` field in the element.  
Deselecting the currently selected option of a Block Kit static option will return a `null` value. For more information about select menu elements, refer to [select menu of static options](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#static_select).
To send this `block_actions` payload for [interactive components](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements) used within [input blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#input), you can set `dispatch_action` to `true` in those input blocks. They are included in [`view_submission` payloads](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views) as well.
## Properties [](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/block-actions#fields)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/block-actions#fields)
This is a list of some properties that can be encountered in this type of interaction payload:
Properties received in a `block_actions` event may differ based on the source of the interactive elements. A check in the column means that property is included in a `block_actions` event sent to a function, a non-function, or both. Functions refer to [workflow apps](https://api.slack.com/automation/interactivity).
Property | Functions | Non-Functions | Description | Required?  
---|---|---|---|---  
`type` | ✓ | ✓ | Helps identify which type of interactive component sent the payload; An interactive element in a block will have a type of `block_actions`, whereas an interactive element in a [message attachment](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments) will have a type of `interactive_message`. | Yes  
`trigger_id` | ✓ | ✓ | A short-lived ID that can be [used to open modals](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#modal_responses). | Yes  
`user` | ✓ | ✓ | The user who interacted to trigger this request. | Yes  
`team` | ✓ | ✓ | The workspace the app is installed on. Null if the app is org-installed. | Yes  
`container` | ✓ | ✓ | The container where this block action took place. | Yes  
`api_app_id` | ✓ | ✓ | A string representing the app ID. | Yes  
`actions.block_id` | ✓ | ✓ | Identifies the block within a surface that contained the interactive component that was used. See the [reference guide for the block you're using](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks) for more info on the `block_id` field. | Yes  
`actions.action_id` | ✓ | ✓ | Identifies the interactive component itself. Some blocks can contain multiple interactive components, so the `block_id` alone may not be specific enough to identify the source component. See the [reference guide for the interactive element you're using](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements) for more info on the `action_id` field. | Yes  
`actions.value` | ✓ | ✓ | Set by your app when you composed the blocks, this is the value that was specified in the interactive component when an interaction happened. For example, a select menu will have multiple possible values depending on what the user picks from the menu, and `value` will identify the chosen option. See the [reference guide for the interactive element you're using](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements) for more info on the `value` field. | Yes  
`token` | ✓ | Represents a deprecated verification token feature. You should validate the request payload, however, and the best way to do so is to [use the signing secret provided to your app](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack). | Yes  
`hash` | ✓ | ✓ | A unique value that is optionally accepted in [`views.update`](https://api.slack.com/methods/views.update) and [`views.publish`](https://api.slack.com/methods/views.publish) API calls. When provided to those APIs, the `hash` is validated such that only the most recent view can be updated. This should be used to ensure the correct view is being updated when updates are happening asynchronously. | Yes  
`function_data` | ✓ | Metadata about the function execution that generated the block where this block action took place. | Yes  
`interactivity` | ✓ | An interactivity object generated as a result of the block action. | Yes  
`bot_access_token` | ✓ | A workflow (just-in-time) token generated for this block action. | Yes  
`enterprise` | ✓ | ✓ | The enterprise the installed app is part of, if the app is either workspace-installed on an org, or org-installed. | No  
`channel` | ✓ | ✓ | The channel where this block action took place. | No  
`message` | ✓ | ✓ | The message where this block action took place, if the block was contained in a message. | No  
`view` | ✓ | ✓ | The view where this block action took place, if the block was contained in a view. | No  
`actions` | ✓ | ✓ | Contains data from the specific [interactive component](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements) that was used. [App surfaces](https://api.slack.com/surfaces) can contain [blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks) with multiple interactive components, and each of those components can have multiple values selected by users. | No  
`state` | ✓ | ✓ | A property including all stateful elements, not just input blocks. | No  
`response_url` | ✓ | (Deprecated for workflow apps) A short-lived [webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) that can be used [to send messages in response to interactions](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#message_responses). | No  
If a user doesn't interact with a form field — for example, they don't select a value from a drop-down field on a modal — the value of that field is returned as `None`.
