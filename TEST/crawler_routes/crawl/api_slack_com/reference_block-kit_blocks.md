Read our guide to [building block layouts](https://api.slack.com/block-kit/building) to learn where and how to use these blocks. You can include up to 50 blocks in each message, and 100 blocks in modals or Home tabs.
## Blocks [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#blocks)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#blocks)
This page describes the JSON payloads that your app can use to generate each block. Select the block you'd like to build:

## Markdown block [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#markdown)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#markdown)
**Displays formatted markdown.**
This block can be used with [AI apps](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps/ai) when you expect a markdown response from an LLM that can get lost in translation rendering in Slack. Providing it in a markdown block leaves the translating to Slack to ensure your message appears as intended. Note that passing a single block may result in multiple blocks after translation.

## Rich text block [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#rich_text)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#rich_text)
**Displays formatted, structured representation of text.**
It is also the output of the Slack client's WYSIWYG message composer, so all messages sent by end-users will have this format. Use this block to include user-defined formatted text in your Block Kit payload. While it is possible to format text with `mrkdwn`, `rich_text` is strongly preferred and allows greater flexibility.
You might encounter a `rich_text` block in a message payload, as a built-in type in workflow apps, or as output of the [`rich_text_input`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#rich_text_input) block element.

### Fields [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#rich_fields)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#rich_fields)
Field | Type | Description | Required?  
---|---|---|---  
`type` | String | The type of block. For a rich text block, `type` is always `rich_text`. | Yes  
`elements` | Object[] | An array of rich text objects - [`rich_text_section`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#rich_text_section), [`rich_text_list`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#rich_text_list), [`rich_text_preformatted`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#rich_text_preformatted), and [`rich_text_quote`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#rich_text_quote). See your specific desired element below for more details. | Yes  
`block_id` | String | A unique identifier for a block. If not specified, one will be generated. Maximum length for this field is 255 characters. `block_id` should be unique for each message or view and each iteration of a message or view. If a message or view is updated, use a new `block_id`. | No  
Rich text blocks can be deeply nested. For instance: a `rich_text_list` can contain a `rich_text_section` which can contain bold style text. More details on how that works is shown in the examples.
Sub-elements are what comprise the `elements` array in a rich text block. There are four available rich text object sub-elements.: `rich_text_section`, `rich_text_list`, `rich_text_preformatted`, and `rich_text_quote`. Because many of the elements include a section block, the details of that element are listed first, followed by the others.

Let's say we want to create a nested list, for example something that looks like this:
Breakfast foods I enjoy:
  * Hashbrowns
  * Eggs 
    * Scrambled
    * Over easy
  * Pancakes, extra syrup


To create that in rich text, create three instances of `rich_text_list`, the middle one using the `indent` property to indent the types of eggs into that sub-list.

`accessory` | Object | One of the compatible [element objects](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#section) noted above. Be sure to confirm the desired element works with `section`. | No  
`expand` | Boolean | Whether or not this section block's text should always expand when rendered. If false or not provided, it may be rendered with a 'see more' option to expand and show the full text. For [AI Assistant apps](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps/ai), this allows the app to post long messages without users needing to click 'see more' to expand the message. | No

## Video block [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#video)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#video)
**Displays an embedded video player.**
A `video` block is designed to embed videos in all app surfaces (e.g. link unfurls, messages, modals, App Home) — anywhere you can put blocks! To use the video block within your app, you must have the [`links.embed:write`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/links.embed:write) scope.
The metadata received in the block payload will be used to construct the description, provider, and title of the video in all clients. Developers have the flexibility to leave non-mandatory fields null and use other blocks to format this content.
### Requirements [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#video_requirements)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#video_requirements)
  * Video blocks can only be posted by apps; users are not allowed to post embedded videos directly from Block Kit Builder.
  * Your app must have the the [`links.embed:write`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/links.embed:write) scope for both user and bot tokens.
  * `video_url` has to be included in the [unfurl domains](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/link-unfurling#configuring_domains) specified in your app.
  * `video_url` should be publicly accessible, unless the app relies on information received from the [Events API](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) payloads to make a decision on whether the viewer(s) of the content should have access. If so, the service could create a unique URL accessible only via Slack.
  * `video_url` must be compatible with an embeddable iFrame.
  * `video_url` must return a 2xx code OR 3xx with less than 5 redirects and an eventual 2xx.
  * `video_url` must not point to any Slack-related domain.


### Constraints[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#video__constraints)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#video__constraints)
  * Embeddable video players only (audio-only permitted)
  * Navigation, scrolling and overlays are not allowed within the iFrame.
  * Interactivity (e.g. likes, comments, and reactions) are allowed within your player but shouldn't completely overlay or navigate away from the content being embedded. These interactions will be anonymous since no user data is transferred to the embedded view.
