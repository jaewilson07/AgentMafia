# Is your Slack app ready for the Slack Marketplace?
_Please note, your app does not need to be listed in the Slack Marketplace for it to work for your own or other Slack workspaces._
Once you've built your app, you can submit it to the Slack Marketplace to be used by other Slack workspaces. For more information on this process, please refer to our documentation on [Submitting apps to the Slack Marketplace](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace/review-guide). We review apps to ensure they provide users with a great experience and comply with our [API TOS](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api), [Developer Policy](https://api.slack.com/developer-policy) and [Brand Guidelines](https://slack.com/brand-guidelines).
Workflow automations are currently not eligible for listing in the Slack Marketplace.
When submitting, please follow our comprehensive checklist shown below, which covers the most common points of failure during the review. This will help your app go through the review process quickly and smoothly.
Read our [Slack Marketplace guide](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace/review-guide) to find out how to [submit your app for publishing](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace/review-guide#submitting) and [update a published app](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace/review-guide#updating).
## App Submission Checklist [](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#checklist)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#checklist)
### Review your permission scopes [](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#review_scopes)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#review_scopes)
  * If I’m submitting a new app to the Slack Marketplace or resubmitting an app that’s already listed, I confirm it uses granular permissions.
  * The scopes requested are the minimum necessary for the service to function. My app does not request broad access to message data or other sensitive information, circumvent Slack’s administrative or privacy controls, nor use the following scopes: `read`, `post`, `client`, `search:read`.
  * My app configuration lists all of the requested scopes in every step of the OAuth flow, and I have provided detailed reasons for how each scope is used.
  * The scopes requested are the minimum necessary for the service to function. My app does not circumvent Slack’s administrative or privacy controls and does not request extensive access to workspace data/other sensitive information (e.g. via `read`, `post`, `client`, `search:read`, `admin.*`, `search:read`, user token `*:history` scopes). It also does not use classic/legacy scopes (e.g. `identity.*`, `workflow.steps:execute`) or workflow automations scopes (e.g. `triggers:*`).


### Review your user experience [](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#review_ux)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#review_ux)
  * My app provides a high quality experience in Slack, suitable for the workplace.
  * Messages from my app use clear, consistent formatting. (Read about [building with blocks](https://api.slack.com/block-kit). You can also use our [Block Kit Builder](https://api.slack.com/block-kit-builder) to see a preview of your messages or find templates for your app.)
  * Messages from my app are free of typos and grammatical errors.
  * My app never contacts any user using any information obtained from Slack without explicit and separate consent from that user to do so.
  * My app only sends direct messages or uses @channel or @here notifications when appropriate.
  * My app does not send messages to the #general channel by default or to a user’s Slackbot direct message.
  * If my app uses a slash command, there’s a way for a user to ask for help or send feedback. For example, the slash command should respond to `/mycommand help` with information about using the app.
  * If using the App Home "Messages" tab, my bot responds to users’ direct messages. It also uses the `app_home_opened` event to send a welcome message the first time any user opens this view. If my bot doesn’t need to listen to users’ messages, I’ve disabled “Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab.”
  * If using the App Home "Home" tab, any content displayed there is helpful and appropriate for the user viewing it.
  * My app only requests domain events that are needed to function.
  * I’ve installed my app on a new workspace to fully test the installation, onboarding, and functionality of the app before submitting it to the Slack Marketplace.
  * My app is ready to support a growing number of users once it’s listed in the Slack Marketplace and is not currently in private beta.
  * My app does not facilitate financial transactions, including cryptocurrency transactions, or the minting or transfer of NFTs in Slack.
  * I will revoke all API tokens for my app when it’s no longer maintained and communicate deprecation plans to users and the Slack Marketplace team.
  * My app uses TLS 1.2 or higher for any redirect URIs, web pages, or endpoints.
  * My app has been installed on 10 or more active workspaces and tested by a group of customers who have provided feedback to improve the user experience. An active workspace is a workspace that has been used in the past 28 days.


### Prepare your Slack Marketplace listing [](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#prep_listing)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#prep_listing)
We have some [guidelines on presenting your Slack app](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace/guidelines) in the Slack Marketplace. Please review them before submission.
  * My app complies with Slack’s [brand guidelines](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/media-kit).
  * My app doesn’t infringe on any trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property rights.
  * My app doesn’t have the same name as another app currently listed in the Slack Marketplace.
  * My app does not use “Slack” in its name or domain name other than to note itself as a third-party integration. (For example, "My Service for Slack" is okay, but "My Slack Service" is not.)
  * My app has a high quality, distinctive icon that doesn’t resemble Slackbot or the Slack icon.
  * My app has a short description of how it works and what it does (10 words or fewer is ideal).
  * My app has a clear, detailed, and truthful long description of what it does.
  * If included, the YouTube link I’ve provided links to a video that clearly explains how to use my app in Slack.
  * If included, I’ve provided high-quality images that clearly explain how to use my app.
  * My app fully supports the languages I have selected.
  * I’ve provided accurate pricing information for my app. (If your app is associated with a paid service that’s required for the app to function, please choose one of the paid options.)


### Review your installation links [](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#review_installation_links)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#review_installation_links)
  * My app owns the domain names for its privacy policy, support, and landing page URLs.
  * My landing page contains a detailed summary of what my app does and how it integrates with Slack. (Please see our [landing page guidelines](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace/guidelines#landing) for more information).
  * My landing page contains clear instructions for configuring and using my app (e.g., which parts of my app trigger messages in Slack, or which comments a bot responds to).
  * My app’s landing page clearly displays the “Add To Slack” button for users to install my app, or it has detailed instructions for accessing the Slack button if it’s behind a login page.
  * My landing page includes a link to an accessible privacy policy that clearly explains how my app will collect, manage, and store third-party data. (If the privacy policy isn’t available in English, you will need to send us a human-translated English version by email.)
  * If included, the direct install URL I’ve provided responds with a 302 redirect back to Slack’s authorization URL.
  * If connecting Slack with private customer data, my app’s OAuth flow uses a state parameter.
  * If my app uses a Large Language Model (e.g ChatGPT), I've included a clear disclaimer in the long description and landing page detailing the potential for my app to generate inaccurate responses, summaries, or other outputs.


### Prepare your customer support [](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#prep_support)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/slack-apps/slack-marketplace-checklist#prep_support)
  * My app links to a page with clear instructions for contacting our team if someone encounters a problem or needs help.
  * Users are not required to create a new account of any kind to contact my team for support.
  * I agree to keep my app updated and my support channel active.

  * We provide users with a mechanism to request to delete, access, and transfer an individual’s data
  * Personal data that is collected and processed is not held or further used unless for reasons that are clearly stated and agreed to in advance to support data privacy.
  * Personal data is collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and kept for no longer than necessary for the purposes of processing.
  * If requested by the customer, I am able to demonstrate compliance with all applicable privacy regulations and laws.
  * I agree to allow Slack to conduct a security review of my app by terms laid out in both the [Slack Marketplace Agreement](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace-agreement) and the [Security Review Guide](https://api.slack.com/security-review).
