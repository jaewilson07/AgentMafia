# Workflow Builder: Legacy steps from apps
**Steps from Apps are now deprecated!** We don't recommend using or creating _Steps from Apps_ for the legacy workflow builder. Instead, build functions and triggers for modern workflows using our new [automation platform](https://api.slack.com/automation). [This tutorial](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tracks/wfb-function) is a great place to start. Alternatively, build a Bolt app that you host and customize it with [custom steps for Bolt apps](https://api.slack.com/concepts/workflow-steps). [Learn more about the deprecation](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2023-08-workflow-steps-from-apps-step-back) or read our [Survival Guide & FAQ](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps/faq).
Steps from apps provided an ability for Slack apps to create and process custom [workflow](https://api.slack.com/workflows) steps. These Steps from Apps could be shared and used by anyone in [Workflow Builder](https://api.slack.com/workflows#intro).
Use Steps from Apps to send data to external services, create tasks in project management systems, or update tickets. Follow our guide to learn how to build your own steps, custom tailored to your organization’s needs.
## What are Steps from Apps and how do they relate to workflows? [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#what)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#what)
A workflow is a multi-step process, where some of the steps are automated by Slack. Workflows are available for end-users in various locations in Slack.
[Workflow Builder](https://api.slack.com/workflows#intro) offers a set of tools to create workflows. There's no code involved, so _anyone_ can create workflows by creating a flow of workflow steps.
In addition to the built-in steps, Slack apps can create and share their own custom Steps from Apps. Users can add these steps to their workflows in Workflow Builder. The app then handles execution of that step in a workflow. The app will receive appropriate context from the workflow, such as user inputs from earlier steps.
This feature will only work for apps using our newest granular permission model. [Learn more](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) about how to create a Slack app.
There is a limit of 100 shortcut-triggered workflows per channel. If you hit this limit, you won't be able to publish any new workflows. For more information, read about [choosing a trigger for your workflow](https://slack.com/help/articles/360053571454-Set-up-a-workflow-in-Slack#h_01EJVP297CA3B1MDG83WJANMEQ).
## Getting started with Steps from Apps [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#getting_started)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#getting_started)
First, you'll need a Slack app. If you don't have one, you may want to [read more about how they work](https://api.slack.com/start/apps). If you just want to create one here and now, let's get started.
[Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps/new)
Whether you have an existing app or a freshly minted one installed to your development workspace, you'll want to go to your [app's settings](https://api.slack.com/apps) for the next step.
### Configure your app [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#configure)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#configure)
There are some [settings](https://api.slack.com/apps) changes required for your app to create and use workflow steps.
The first thing you'll need to do, if you haven't already, is to enable interactivity in your app.
Go to the _Interactivity & Shortcuts_ section and flip the switch to 'on'. You'll need to fill in the **Request URL** field with a URL capable of [handling interaction payloads](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads). You'll start receiving those payloads from use of your app's steps.
The next step involves subscribing to an event and adding a permission scope, and you can add these yourself as explained below. They will, however, also be automatically added to your app's settings when [creating your first workflow step later in this guide](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#create).
You'll need to subscribe to an [Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api) type called [`workflow_step_execute`](https://api.slack.com/events/workflow_step_execute). This event will notify your app when a step it created has been used. Add it under the _Event Subscriptions_ section of [your app's settings](https://api.slack.com/apps).
Subscribing to the `workflow_step_execute` event also requires that your app request a [permission scope](https://api.slack.com/scopes) called [`workflow.steps:execute`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/workflow.steps:execute). Add it in the _OAuth & Permissions_ section, under _Bot Token Scopes_.
Your app will need to be re-authenticated anywhere it is already installed after you add a new scope. Otherwise, users will not see your steps in the step library.
**Please note** : Organizations with admin-approved apps turned on will need to approve any re-authentication. Otherwise, only the user will be asked to go through the re-authentication flow – there will be no additional work for the administrator.
### Create a workflow step [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#create)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#create)
In your [app's config](https://api.slack.com/apps), click on the _Workflow Steps_ section. Select the toggle to opt-in — this will automatically add a few settings (such as permission scopes and event subscriptions) so that you can start creating workflow steps.
You'll see a _Steps_ section, listing any steps you've already created in your app. Each app can create up to 10 steps. Click the _Add Step_ button, you'll see a modal appear with fields to configure your app's new step:
  * **Step name** - a descriptive name which is shown to the Workflow Builder user.
  * **Callback ID** - a string that will act as a unique identifier for this particular step. It will be sent back to you with each action involving your step.


Click _Save_ and you've created your app's first workflow step!
Your app's step will now be available to Workflow Builder users in workspaces where:
  * Your app is installed.
  * An owner or admin has enabled the Steps from Apps feature in the workspace or Enterprise Grid org's settings.


### Prepare your app for Workflow Builder [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_wfb)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_wfb)
Here is the flow that occurs when a user adds your app's step in Workflow Builder:
  1. User inserts your app's step to a workflow, [your app receives a `workflow_step_edit` payload](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_workflow_step_edit).
  2. App uses the `trigger_id` from that payload to open a [configuration `view` modal](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_config_view).
  3. User completes configuration modal and submits. [Your app receives a `view_submission` payload](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_view_submission).
  4. App [creates a `workflow_step` object](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_workflow_step_obj), and makes a call to `workflows.updateStep`.
  5. Step is successfully added to the user's workflow.


Good news: the [Bolt frameworks for Javascript](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/concepts#creating-steps), [Python](https://slack.dev/bolt-python/concepts#creating-steps), and [Java](https://slack.dev/java-slack-sdk/guides/steps-from-apps) handle all these details for you!
If you're already using one of these frameworks and you've got a step running, you can skip to [keeping track of the workflows the use your steps](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#tracking). Otherwise, if you'd like to implement the flow yourself, let's dig in.
#### Receiving the `workflow_step_edit` payload [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_workflow_step_edit)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_workflow_step_edit)
At this point in the flow, an [interaction payload](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads) will be sent to the interactive request URL configured [above](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#configure).
Read our [guide to handling interaction payloads](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads) to understand how to receive and parse them. You can find a [reference guide to the fields included in the `workflow_step_edit` type payload here](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/workflow_step_edit).
#### Opening a configuration modal [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_config_view)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_config_view)
When someone building a workflow inserts your app's step, they will need a way to pass along information entered by end-users in earlier steps. We can use what we call a **configuration modal** to enable this.
Each field in your configuration modal should allow the builder to define the source for all input data that your app requires. The builder will be able to insert Handlebars-like `{{variables}}` into any [plain-text field](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#input) to auto-populate _output_ data from previous steps.
The configuration modal can also be used to configure data that _doesn't_ come from end-users, but is defined only by the Workflow Builder user.
This type of modal can be used in much the [same way as regular modals](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using). The `workflow_step_edit` payload mentioned above will contain a `trigger_id` that is needed to [open the modal](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#opening_modals).
Most existing Block Kit components can be used to [define the configuration modal `view` object](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#composing_views).
There are a few differences between the use of regular modals and configuration modals:
  * The `type` property in the modal `view` will be `workflow_step` instead of `modal`.
  * When the `submit_disabled` property is set to `true` the submit button will be disabled until the user has completed one or more inputs.
  * Apps cannot specify `title`, `submit` or the `close` properties.
  * A configuration modal view [can be updated](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#updating_views) as long as it remains open, but you cannot [push new views to the modal view stack](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#modal_flow).
  * Configuring users will see an option to _Insert a variable_ below any [plain-text input blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#input) in your configuration modal. This allows the configuring user to specify that the value for any given field should be equal to the value of something collected from an end-user in an earlier workflow step. See [below for more about variables](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#variables).


#### Saving the configuration data using Bolt [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_view_submission)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_view_submission)
When a configuration modal is submitted, your app will be sent a [`view_submission` interaction payload](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#handling_submissions).
If you're using Bolt, you can easily acknowledge and process this payload by using the `save` callback in the `WorkflowStep` class:

  );

The `update` function will make a call to the [`workflows.updateStep` Web API method](https://api.slack.com/methods/workflows.updateStep). This method stores the configuration of your app's step _for a specified workflow_.
There are a couple of arguments that the `update` function requires - `input` and `output`.
  * `inputs` is a key-value map of objects describing data required by your app's step. Input values can contain Handlebars `{{variables}}`, which are used to include values from the _outputs_ of some earlier step in the workflow.
  * `outputs` is an array of objects that describe the data your app's step will return when completed. Subsequent steps in the workflow _after_ your app's step will be able to use these outputs as variables.


Read the reference guides for [`input` objects](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/workflow_step#input) and [`output` objects](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/workflow_step#output) to learn their full structure.
**Saving configuration data manually**
If you're not using Bolt, your app can manually [acknowledge and close the modal view](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#closing_views) and [show errors as usual](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#displaying_errors). You **can’t use any other type of`response_action`** with configuration modals.
Then use the information collected from the [configuration modal](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_config_view) to form the arguments needed to call the [Web API method `workflows.updateStep`](https://api.slack.com/methods/workflows.updateStep). This method will confirm and save the configuration for your app's step within this particular workflow.
The workflow will now be saved with your app's step nestled inside. Let's move on to what happens when someone _uses_ that newly created workflow.
### Handle usage of workflows containing your app's steps [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_steps)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#handle_steps)
When you switched on the _Workflow Steps_ feature in your app, you were automatically subscribed to the [`workflow_step_execute` event](https://api.slack.com/events/workflow_step_execute). This event will be sent to your app every time a workflow containing one of the app's steps is used.
Using Bolt, you can listen for and respond to this event by adding an `execute` callback to your `WorkflowStep` class:

Copyimport java.util.*;

 .save((req, ctx) -> { return ctx.ack(); })
 .execute((req, ctx) -> {
  WorkflowStepExecution wfStep = req.getPayload().getEvent().getWorkflowStep();
  Map<String, Object> outputs = new HashMap<>();
  outputs.put("taskName", wfStep.getInputs().get("taskName").getValue());
  outputs.put("taskDescription", wfStep.getInputs().get("taskDescription").getValue());
  outputs.put("taskAuthorEmail", wfStep.getInputs().get("taskAuthorEmail").getValue());
  try {
   ctx.complete(outputs);
  } catch (Exception e) {
   Map<String, Object> error = new HashMap<>();
   error.put("message", "Something wrong!");
   ctx.fail(error);
  }
  return ctx.ack();
 })
 .build();
app.step(step);

[Powered by Bolt for Python](https://slack.dev/bolt-python)
The [event payload](https://api.slack.com/events/workflow_step_execute) will include `inputs` that contain any values that your step requires. These inputs come from earlier in the workflow, or from something entered in the configuration modal when the workflow step was being inserted.
You can process information from the payload or use any other relevant data to complete the step. Your app can make API calls, publish to a database, switch a lightbulb on, refresh a [user's App Home](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/tabs), or do anything else that is relevant to the step.
That said, within the `execute` callback your app _must_ either call `complete()` to indicate that step execution was successful, or `fail()` to indicate that step execution failed.
The `complete` function expects an `outputs` object, the shape of which is dictated by the `outputs` array sent earlier in the `WorkflowStep.save` callback. Use the `name` from each object in that array as keys, mapped to the calculated value for each output.
**Handling workflow execution manually**
If you're not using Bolt, read our [guide to the Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api#receiving_events). This guide explains how to [receive and handle event notifications](https://api.slack.com/events-api#receiving_events), which includes `workflow_step_execute`.
Non-Bolt apps also need to manually indicate the outcome of the step execution. Make a call to the [Web API method `workflows.stepCompleted`](https://api.slack.com/methods/workflows.stepCompleted) to indicate a successful outcome. A call to [`workflows.stepFailed`](https://api.slack.com/methods/workflows.stepFailed) should come after a failed attempt to complete the step.
You can check the `Activity` tab in Workflow Builder to inspect every run of your workflow. Any error messages for failed runs will appear there.
Well done - you've now stepped through all the steps needed to step up your workflow step game!
## Handling edits [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#editing)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#editing)
Once your step has been added to a workflow, configuring users will have an option to customize your step through an _Edit_ button in Workflow Builder.
Clicking that _Edit_ button dispatches another [`workflow_step_edit`](https://api.slack.com/reference/workflows/workflow_step_edit) payload to your interactive request URL, and the user’s previously configured inputs.
## Step tracking [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#tracking)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#tracking)
Count your steps by [subscribing](https://api.slack.com/apps) to four new events: [`workflow_published`](https://api.slack.com/events/workflow_published), [`workflow_unpublished`](https://api.slack.com/events/workflow_unpublished), [`workflow_deleted`](https://api.slack.com/events/workflow_deleted), and [`workflow_step_deleted`](https://api.slack.com/events/workflow_step_deleted).
These events notify your app when another workflow including a step powered by your app has been published, unpublished, or deleted, as well as when one of the steps is removed from a workflow. Use these events to keep track of which workflows make use of your steps.
## Known issues [](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#known_issues)[](https://api.slack.com/legacy/workflows/steps#known_issues)
  * There is a minor, visual issue with validation errors under input blocks.
