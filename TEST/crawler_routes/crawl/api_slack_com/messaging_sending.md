# Send or schedule a message
Apps that only _listen_ can be useful, but there's so much more utility to explore by transforming a monologue into a conversation. Give your app the gift of dialogue by setting it up to send Slack messages.
This guide will help you learn a basic way to accomplish this and show you the paths you can take to make things complex and interactive.
## Sending messages [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#getting_started)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#getting_started)
If you don't have a Slack app yet, [here's a guide to help you create one](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#creating). Make sure you create the app in a workspace that won't mind you posting lots of test messages.
Once you've done that, come back here and keep reading.
### Requesting the necessary permissions [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#permissions)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#permissions)
Each Slack app starts off without permission to do very much at all. You will have to grant your app the correct scopes required in order for you to publish messages. There are [lots of scopes available](https://api.slack.com/scopes), and you can read our [OAuth guide](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) for more information on why they're needed, and what they do.
For the purposes of this guide, however, we'll skip over that and just tell you the permissions we need right now.
The first is [`channels:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read). That scope lets your app retrieve a list of all the public channels in a workspace so that you can [pick one to publish a message to](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#conversations). If you already know the ID of the channel you wish to send messages to, you can skip out on requesting `channels:read`.
The second is [`chat:write`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/chat:write). This one grants permission for your app to send messages as itself (apps _can_ send messages as users or bot users, but [we'll cover that later](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#impersonation)).
To request permissions:
  1. Open the settings for your app from the [App Management](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.
  2. In the navigation menu, select **OAuth & Permissions**.
  3. Scroll down to the **Scopes** section, and pick `channels:read` and `chat:write` from the drop-down menu.
  4. Click **Save changes**.
  5. Scroll back to the top of this page and look for the button that says **Install App to Workspace** (or **Reinstall App** if you've done this before). Click it. You'll now see a permission request screen to install your app to its original workspace.


If you had already installed your app to its original workspace before, you might still see the permissions screen if the scopes you just added weren't previously granted to your app.
Authorize your app, and you should see a success message. On the **OAuth & Permissions** page you're brought back to, you should now see an OAuth access token available. Grab this token and store it for later, as we'll use that token to make some [Web API](https://api.slack.com/web) calls.
### Picking the right conversation [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#conversations)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#conversations)
Now we need to find somewhere within your workspace to send a message. This [could be any Slack conversation](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/messages#conversations), but we'll use a public channel.
We'll remind you again, it's not a good idea to attempt the instructions in this guide with a real, living workspace. If you really have to, at least [create a new, empty public channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel) within the workspace for testing purposes.
In order to find a valid Slack conversation ID, we'll use the [`conversations.list` API method](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list). This API will return a list of all public channels in the workspace your app is installed to. You'll need the [`channels:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read) permission granted to your app.
Within that list, we'll be able to find a specific `id` of the conversation that we want to access. Here's an example API call:

          // Print result

CopyGET https://slack.com/api/conversations.list

```

You'll get back a JSON object, with a `channels` array containing all the public channels that your app can see. You can find your channel by looking for the `name` in each object.
When you've found the matching channel, make note of the `id` value, as you'll need it for certain API calls.
If your app implements [shortcuts](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/shortcuts), [slash commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands), or uses the [Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api), your app will see conversation `id`s in request payloads sent by those features.
In those cases, your app can dynamically respond using the payload data to identify the relevant conversation, rather than needing to use the `conversations.list` method described above.
Now that we've picked a destination, we need to decide what our message will look like.
### Composing your message [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#composing)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#composing)
Designing a message is a complicated topic, so we've [broken it out into its own section](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting) that you can read at your leisure.
For this guide, we'll just publish a plain-text message. Here's the [message payload](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/messages#payloads) we're going to send:
```
{
 "channel": "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
 "text": "Hello, world"
}

```

That seems appropriate, right? Let's get down to the actual business of sending this message.
### Publishing your message [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#publishing)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#publishing)
We're nearly there; we just need to make one more API call, this time to [`chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage). Again, substitute in the values of the token and conversation ID that you noted earlier:

```

This time we're using a POST request, so your token from before has to be included in the header of the request as a [bearer token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750).
Submit the request and your message should be delivered instantly. You'll get back a response payload containing an `ok` confirmation value of `true`, and other data such as the `channel` the message was posted to. One very important piece of information in this response is the `ts` value, which is essentially the ID of the message, and which you'll need if you want to [reply to this message](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#threading).
Locate the Slack conversation the message was sent to and it should be waiting for you:
![Message in Slack conversation that says Hello, world](https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/api/messaging_getting_started_helloworld.png)
Amazing work! You've now implemented one of the core pieces of functionality for any Slack app. Keep reading to see how you can add a little more complexity.
### Replying to your message [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#threading)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#threading)
In some cases, you might find it more useful for your app to reply to another message, creating a [thread](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/messages#threading). For example, if your app is sending a message [in response to being mentioned](https://api.slack.com/bot-users#responding-to-mentions), then it makes sense to add a [threaded reply](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/messages#threading) to the source of the mention.
[Make sure the message you want to reply to isn't a reply itself](https://api.slack.com/messaging/retrieving#finding_threads), as shown in our [retrieving messages guide](https://api.slack.com/messaging/retrieving#finding_threads).
For this guide, we'll assume the message is an unthreaded one. In fact, let's reply to the message [you just published](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#publishing). You need three pieces of information to reply in a thread:
  * An access token with the right permissions, like the [`token` created earlier](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#permissions).
  * The `channel` that the parent message lives in.
  * The `ts` value of the parent message.


You should still have the last two pieces of information from the response payload you received after [publishing the parent message](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#publishing).
In more generic terms, you can also find the `ts` value of messages by following our [guide to retrieving individual messages](https://api.slack.com/messaging/retrieving#individual_messages).
Pulling all that data together, we can make another [`chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) API call to publish a reply:

You'll see another API response payload containing information about the newly published threaded reply. Return to the same conversation in Slack, and you'll see your original message now has a reply:
![Message in Slack conversation that says Hello, world with a reply saying Hello again!](https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/api/messaging_getting_started_threading.png)
When publishing threaded reply messages, you can also supply a `reply_broadcast` boolean parameter, as listed in the relevant API docs. This parameter, if set to `true`, will 'broadcast' a reference to the threaded reply to the parent conversation. Read more about the [Slack user-facing equivalent of this feature here](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Message-and-file-threads#reply_to_channel).
### Sending messages as other entities [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#impersonation)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#impersonation)
Apps can publish messages that appear to have been created by a user in the conversation. The message will be attributed to the user and show their profile photo beside it.
This is a powerful ability and must only be used when the user themselves gives permission to do so. For this reason, this ability is only available when an app has requested and been granted an additional scope — [`chat:write.customize`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/chat:write.customize).
Your app should only use this feature in response to an inciting user action. It should never be unexpected or surprising to a user that a message was posted on their behalf, and it should be heavily signposted in advance.
To modify the appearance of the app, make calls to [`chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) while providing any of the following parameters:
  * `username` to specify the username for the published message.
  * `icon_url` to specify a URL to an image to use as the profile photo alongside the message.
  * `icon_emoji` to specify an emoji (using colon shortcodes, eg. `:white_check_mark:`) to use as the profile photo alongside the message.


If the `channel` parameter is set to a User ID (beginning with `U`), the message will appear in that user's direct message channel with Slackbot. To post a message to that user's direct message channel with the app, use the DM ID (beginning with `D`) instead.
## Scheduling messages [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#scheduling)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#scheduling)
Scheduling a message is just a bit of fancy footwork on top of sending a message directly. One thing you'll need before starting is a [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps). If you don't have one yet, [here's a very quick guide to help you create one](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#creating). Make sure you create the app in a workspace that won't mind you posting lots of test messages!
### Permissions [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#scheduling-permissions)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#scheduling-permissions)
Now for some particularly pleasant permissions news: your app's permissions are actually the ones you've already acquired to post messages!
Let’s quickly recap. Your app uses a bot token to perform actions as itself. You grant your app permission to perform specific actions by giving its bot token the corresponding scopes.
For your app to send scheduled messages, it only needs one scope: [`chat:write`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/chat:write).
If you don't already know the ID of the channel you wish to send messages to, you may also want to give your app another scope: [`channels:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read). This scope lets your app retrieve a list of all the public channels in a workspace so you can [pick one to publish a message to](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#conversations).
### Schedule a message [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#scheduling-a-message)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#scheduling-a-message)
Our guide to directly sending messages talked you through a call to [`chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage). Let's reinvent our app to send a reminder instead: say, about a weekly team breakfast.
```
{
 "channel": "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
 "text": "Hey, team. Don't forget about breakfast catered by John Hughes Bistro today."
}

```

If you want to do things the hard way, your app **could** implement state storage and job scheduling to send this message at the right time each week, using a database and batch task runner.
If you prefer an easier approach, use a scheduled message instead. Add a `post_at` parameter to your JSON request, and pass your JSON to [`chat.scheduleMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.scheduleMessage) instead of `chat.postMessage`:

![Message in Slack conversation that shows a breakfast reminder from the Breakfast Club app](https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/api/messaging_breakfast_club_app.png)
Messages can only be scheduled up to 120 days in advance. 
The HTTP response from `chat.scheduleMessage` includes a `scheduled_message_id`, which can be used to [delete the scheduled message](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#deleting) before it is sent. Read on to find out how.
### List your scheduled messages [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#listing)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#listing)
"Fire and forget" reminders are all well and good, but the best-laid breakfast plans sometimes fall through. Let's say a holiday closes the office during one of your team's scheduled breakfast clubs. Better cancel that reminder message!
Your app can list all the messages that it currently has scheduled with the [`chat.scheduledMessages.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.scheduledMessages.list) endpoint.
Call `chat.scheduledMessages.list` with optional `channel`, `latest`, and `oldest` parameters to specify which channel and time range you're interested in:

`oldest` signifies the Unix timestamp of the earliest range you're interested in. `latest` signifies, well, the latest. So `oldest` must be less than `latest` if both are specified.
The endpoint yields scheduled messages sent by your app, plus [pagination information](https://api.slack.com/docs/pagination).
```

  "ok": true,
  "scheduled_messages": [
    {
      "id": "YOUR_SCHEDULED_MESSAGE_ID",

You'll receive the typical success response once your scheduled message has been deleted.
### Update a scheduled message [](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#updating)[](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#updating)
To update a pending scheduled message, [delete](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#deleting) the old message and then [schedule](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending#scheduling) a new one.
Reminders, notifications, even calendars—all now fall within grasp of your app. You don't have to store any state at all if you don't wish to. Instead, list and delete your scheduled messages on the fly. Combine scheduled messages with [user interactivity](https://api.slack.com/messaging/interactivity) to create a chat bot that's a capable, clever assistant. Enjoy the newfound simplicity of scheduled messages!
