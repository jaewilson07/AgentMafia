# Canvases
Canvases are simple but powerful documents built into Slack. Canvases can either exist attached to a channel or all on their own. Here are some uses for canvases to inspire you:
✨ Use a channel canvas in a feedback channel to instruct users how to submit feedback in a desired format or denote certain urgency.
✨ Welcome new team members with an onboarding canvas filled with tasks, team resources, and user references of their fellow comrades.
✨ Create a canvas in connection with an incident to gather all pertinent information in one place.
Canvases can be added to Slack apps via the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/methods?query=canvas) or with a [built-in function](https://api.slack.com/automation/functions) in a workflow app. How you format canvas content depends on how you are interacting with it—whether that is through the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/methods?query=canvas) or with a [built-in function](https://api.slack.com/automation/functions) in a worflow app. Note that currently, Block Kit is not supported in canvases.
## Formatting canvas content with the Slack API [](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#api)[](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#api)
When [creating](https://api.slack.com/methods/canvases.create) or [editing](https://api.slack.com/methods/canvases.edit) a canvas with the API, you will encounter a `document_content` object, which contains two properites of its own: `type`, and `markdown`. Currently, the only supported `type` is `markdown`.
The `document_content` object supports the following [markdown](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/basic-syntax/) elements:
  * bold
  * bulleted lists
  * [checklist](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/extended-syntax/#task-lists)
  * canvas unfurl
  * [code block](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)
  * code span
  * divider (horizontal rule)
  * [emojis](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/extended-syntax/#emoji)—standard and custom
  * file unfurls
  * hard line break
  * headings h1-h3
  * italic
  * link (in line)
  * link reference
  * message unfurl
  * ordered lists
  * paragraph
  * profile unfurl
  * quote block
  * [strikethrough](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/extended-syntax/#strikethrough)
  * website unfurl
  * @ mentions for users and channels


### Markdown formatting [](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#markdown-formatting)[](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#markdown-formatting)
Markdown formatting varies slightly for standard elements, like headers and quotes, and Slack-specific elements, like user and channel mentions.
For guidance on markdown formatting for standard elements, refer to [this markdown guide](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/basic-syntax/) and our internal documentation [Formatting text for surfaces](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting).
For Slack-specific elements, the markdown syntax for canvases is a bit different. For example, a channel mention, where the channel ID is `C123ABC456`:
```
Why not join ![](#C123ABC456)

```

And a user mention, where the user ID is `U123ABCDEFG`:
```
![](@U123ABCDEFG)

```

In both of these cases, the link will automatically be converted to show the channel name or user card, respectively. If any of the channel members do not have access to the linked channel, they will see an unclickable `private channel` label.
Below are some more examples of these Slack-specific elements in action.
### Project canvas example [](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#project-canvas)[](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#project-canvas)
Given the example request of this code:
```
POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.canvases.create
Request
{
 "channel_id": "C07317JTXCP",
 "document_content": 
 {
 "type":"markdown",
 "markdown":"# Headers\n# Status\n:large_green_circle: On Track\n# Goal\nThe channel to coordinate the build, testing, and launch of Platypus\n# :people_hugging:Stakeholders\n![](@U071CCRCVFH)\n\n![](@UQSSGHV0Q)\n# :books:Resources\n* Project Plan\n* Google Drive\n# :slack:Related channels\n* ![](#C073UAJRW4R) - Project Channel\n* ![](#C073UAJRW4R) - GTM Channel"}
}

```

Here's the same content in a more human-readable format:
```
 # Headers 
 # Status 
 :large_green_circle: On Track 
 # Goal 
 The channel to coordinate the build, testing, and launch of Platypus 
 # :people_hugging:Stakeholders 
 ![](@U071CCRCVFH)
 
 ![](@UQSSGHV0Q) 
 # :books:Resources 
 * Project Plan 
 * Google Drive 
 # :slack:Related channels 
 * ![](#C073UAJRW4R) - Project Channel 
 * ![](#C073UAJRW4R) - GTM Channel

```

The ouput canvas would look like the channel canvas in this image: ![Project canvas example](https://a.slack-edge.com/4e385e9/img/api/surfaces/project_canvas_example.png)
#### Unfurl behavior [](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#unfurl)[](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#unfurl)
Some objects, like user references, support both "card" and "title" unfurls. This unfurling behavior is contextual. To be unfurled as a "card" (like the image above for this example), the reference needs to be in its own syntax block. If the reference is is a child of another syntax block, the unfurl will be a "title" style. In this example, the double spacing around the users (the `\n\n` part) ensures the user mentions unfurl as a card.
#### Referencing an image [](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#image)[](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#image)
When referencing an image in the `document_content` field, you can pass a publicly-hosted image URL.
Alternatively, to reference an image that is already hosted in Slack, pass the image permalink for the URL value.
If the image hasn’t been uploaded already, you’ll first need to upload it. Instructions to do so can be found in [Uploading files](https://api.slack.com/messaging/files#uploading_files) in the files documentation. Once completed, you can use the returned file ID with the [`files.info`](https://api.slack.com/methods/files.info) endpoint to find the image permalink.
For which permalink to use, refer to [Permalinks](https://api.slack.com/types/file#permalinks) in the file object documentation.
Once you have the permalink, pass the value to your canvas like this:
```
POST https://slack.com/api/canvases.edit
Request
{
 "canvas_id": "F072RA30WRL",
 "changes": [{
 "operation": "insert_after",
 "document_content": {
 "type":"markdown",
 "markdown":"![graph](https://your_workspace_URL.slack.com/files/U071SRU8BA7/F073FVDABQS/image.png)"
 },
 "section_id": "temp:C:YKV9b3fab0f992e4080ae952deca"
 }]}

```

Let's look at another example of this in a weekly newsletter example.
### Weekly newsletter example [](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#weekly-newsletter)[](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#weekly-newsletter)
To create a weekly newsletter canvas for your team, it could look something like this:
```

## Formatting canvas content with a built-in Slack function [](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#builtin)[](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#builtin)
Formatting canvas content within a workflow app (i.e. a Deno-based, Slack-hosted app) is different. If you are [creating](https://api.slack.com/reference/functions/canvas_create) or [updating](https://api.slack.com/reference/functions/canvas_update_content) a canvas with the built-in Slack methods, you will encounter a `content` input parameter that is an expanded rich text object. Refer to the automation types page for an example of [`expanded_rich_text`](https://api.slack.com/automation/types#expandedrichtext) and all of its sub-elements.
## Finding canvases with `files.list` [](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#search_canvas)[](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/canvases#search_canvas)
To programatically look up a list of canvases, use the [`files.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/files.list) method while filtering for the `canvas` type. Your query may look something like this `https://slack.com/api/files.list?types=canvas`.
