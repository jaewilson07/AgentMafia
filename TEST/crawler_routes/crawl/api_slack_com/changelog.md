# Developer changelog
Updates to the Slack platform
We improve the Slack platform every day by releasing new features, fixing bugs, and delivering fresh documentation. The developer changelog is an account of what's happening.
We also offer this wonderfully antiquated [RSS feed](https://api.slack.com/changelog.rss). Use the slash command `/feed subscribe https://api.slack.com/changelog.rss` to receive these updates in a Slack channel.

## Important updates
Deprecation
We want to update you about our [previous announcement](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2024-09-legacy-custom-bots-classic-apps-deprecation) regarding support for legacy custom bots and classic apps. After much consideration and feedback, we have decided to push back the deprecation date for classic apps by 6 months: we will now discontinue support for them on **March 31, 2026**. Nothing will change for legacy custom bots, of which the original deprecation date was **March 31, 2025**.

Deprecation
We [previously](https://api.slack.com/changelog#entry-december_2023_0) mentioned that we had deprecated the `deno` command and removed its listing from the `help` command. We have now removed the `deno` command completely. Developers who were depending on this command should now use the deno executable directly. We've also removed support for the deprecated, pre-release Deno Slack SDK versions that used `slack.yaml` and `project.ts` files. The Run-on-Slack platform no longer supports the `slack.yaml` file format, and no production projects should be affected. The `project.ts` file was deprecated by the Deno Slack SDK in favor of `manifest.ts` and `manifest.json` files.

Today is the day! As [previously mentioned](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2024-12-api-site-migration), the Slack platform and developer tools documentation are moving: the shiny new Slack platform documentation is now in beta on [docs.slack.dev](https://docs.slack.dev/), and the developer tools documentation has fully moved to its new home on [tools.slack.dev](https://tools.slack.dev/). The doors are open for our housewarming party 🥳 so come on in, take a look around, and let us know what you think. Thanks for coming along on this journey with us!

## February 2025
Slack CLI
Version `3.0.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is here, with lots of goodies for you! 
We renamed the `slack.json` file to `.slack/hooks.json`, and continue to support `slack.json` for existing projects. There is now a warning shown in `--verbose` output to encourage projects to migrate their `slack.json` to `.slack/hooks.json.`
We've removed the `invalid_app_directory` error from any commands run in nested project directories, and now search for the required `slack.json` file in the project's configuration. We also now also check for this file at `.slack/hooks.json`.
We now cache the last known manifest export; the cache is used to avoid overwriting changes on app settings. If the manifest is changed on app settings since the last update, a confirmation prompt will appear before making another update via the Slack CLI.
We've moved the top-level commands you know and love, `slack create` and `slack samples`, to be sub-commands of the `slack project` command (they remain aliased as top-level commands though, so there is no change to the user experience).
We've updated the `slack doctor` command to display the `manifest.source` value, which will be either `local` or `remote`.
We now officially support Bolt for JavaScript and Bolt for Python in the Slack CLI! 🎉 
As such, we've updated the `slack create` command with a new create journey that allows you to choose between different types of apps for Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, and Deno.
We've also added the `slack init` command, which will initialize an existing Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, or Deno project with Slack CLI support.
We fixed a bug to avoid confusion with regular outputs, and now prefix all separate debug logs with a timestamp.
We fixed a bug to avoid spinning the spinner when outputting with debug logs, or if styles are removed with the `--no-color` flag.
We fixed a bug to now display uninstalled apps in selections when using the `slack collaborators` and `slack manifest` commands.
We fixed a bug with confirming trusted templates that are from a Slack GitHub organization.
We fixed a bug regarding writing console outputs to activity logs during local runs.
We fixed a bug where the Slack CLI would get stuck if one of the goroutines of the `slack run` command encountered an error; we now exit the `slack run` command if this happens.

You can now display runtime versions for your application's execution environment using the `doctor` hook. To enjoy the improved `slack doctor` command experience, existing Deno Slack SDK-based apps must have their `deno-slack-hooks` dependency upgraded to the latest version (`v1.3.0`).
By relying only on the `get-manifest` hook when attempting to get a manifest rather than checking for a `slack.yaml` file, we now surface any errors that are returned when getting the manifest.

We now include a remediation message for the `not_authed` error that explains how to log in and authorize the Slack CLI.
Users can now request app approval at the workspace level on Enterprise Grid.
We now include the error code in event payloads to logstash.
We fixed a bug to output a link if opening the URL in a browser fails.

Slack CLI
Version `2.13.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has landed! 
We've added an `--all-org-workspace-grants` flag to the `app list` command so you can display all grants instead of only the first three.
We've combined `workspace` and `org` language into `team`; as such, we have added a `--team` flag and deprecated the `--workspace` flag. Note that this will not affect the usage of workspace or org when it is necessary to distinguish between them; for example, with the `hermes auth list` and `trigger access` commands.
We removed the redirect to the `delete` command when running the `uninstall` command, so you may now only uninstall an app rather than deleting the app entirely along with all of its data.
We've updated the Slack CLI installer to align the Deno runtime version with the current version supported by the Slack platform.
We've updated all `deno-reverse-string` sample app references to use `deno-started-template` instead.

We've added a [`slack trigger list --type=<string>`](https://api.slack.com/automation/cli/commands#trigger-list) flag to only list triggers of a specific type: For example, `slack trigger list --type=shortcut`. We've also supported flag values for `--type=<string>` are `all`, `shortcut`, `event`, `webhook`, `scheduled`, and `external`.
We've added flags to provide values for many interactive prompts. Learn more about the flags available by adding `--help` to any command. For example, `slack external-auth add-secret --provider github --secret my-secret-value`. 
We've updated the `slack app list` command to improve displaying apps you are not authenticated to access. For example, local apps now display a `(local)` label and install status is now shown as `Status: Unknown`.
We removed an incorrect timestamp found in the Slack debug log file.

When using the Slack CLI in a non-interactive environment, such as in a CI pipeline, selection prompts will error and suggest a flag alternative to use instead of hanging indefinitely.
Trigger generation prompts will be automatically skipped when using `slack run` or `slack deploy` in a non-interactive environment, regardless of how many triggers might exist.

## June 2023
Slack CLI
Version `2.5.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is hot off the press!
We've added a confirmation message if you decide not to delete an app when using the `slack app delete` command.
We added a `--hide-triggers` flag to the `slack run` and `slack deploy` commands to prevent retrieving and displaying application triggers.
We added a warning to listed trigger info that Slack Connect channels do not support event triggers.
We added app collaborators to listed trigger info.
We added support to limit paginated results with the `trigger list --limit <n>` command.
We added a prompt for whether you would like to include/exclude app collaborators into the named entities list if you set your trigger's ACL to `named_entities`. The `include-app-collaborators` flag will allow you to skip this prompt.
We updated the `slack activity` command to support datastore event and error logs. For more information, refer to [logging](https://api.slack.com/automation/logging).
When the `--token` flag is set, background checks for updates will now be automatically disabled.
We added support to fall back to a `curl` install of `deno` if `deno upgrade` should fail.
The `slack logout` command now accepts the `--workspace` flag.

Slack CLI
Version `2.3.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has arrived! 
The `external-auth remove` command now allows you to select a token for deletion.
The new `external-auth select-auth` command allows you to select a unique auth for each of the workflows in an app. This command is mandatory when using new coded workflows that have a step containing `credentialSource DEVELOPER`; that is, every time a coded workflow is created, this command must be called after the `external-auth add` command.
The `slack auth token` and `slack auth revoke` commands allow you to manage service tokens.
The `slack auth token` command allows you to get the `slackauthticket` and copy and paste it into your workspace to exchange for the service token. The service token will not be saved to your `credentials.json` file; instead, it is presented in the prompt for you to copy and paste to your CI/CD pipelines. Once you obtained a service token, you can use the `slack login --auth <your-service-token>` command to authorize your Slack CLI. The service token will not conflict with your regular authentication token; you can continue using your regular authentication token within the Slack CLI while using the service token for your CI/CD pipelines.
The new global `--token <token>` flag allows you to pass the service token used by requests requiring authentication. For example, to install an app, use: `slack install --token <your-service-token>`. To create a trigger, use: `slack trigger create --token <your-service-token> --app deployed --trigger-def triggers/trigger_def_file.ts`. To deploy an app, use: `slack deploy --token <your-service-token>`
We added support for a global `--experiment [name,name,...]` flag.

Read more about it in this [announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/introducing-sign-in-with-slack-290949e1c3f5#.hghansb1o).

We've added two new API methods: [`users.identity`](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.identity) works with [Sign in with Slack](https://api.slack.com/docs/sign-in-with-slack) and [`auth.revoke`](https://api.slack.com/methods/auth.revoke) revokes hallway privileges for access tokens. Actually, it revokes the whole token.
