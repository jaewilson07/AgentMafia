Composition objects can be used inside of [block elements](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements) and certain [message payload](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/messages#payloads) fields. They are common JSON object patterns that you'll encounter frequently when [building blocks](https://api.slack.com/block-kit/building) or [composing messages](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/messages).
The lists of fields and values below describe the JSON that apps can use to generate each object.

Field | Type | Description | Required?  
---|---|---|---  
`type` | String | The formatting to use for this text object. Can be one of `plain_text`or `mrkdwn`. | Yes

`verbatim` | Boolean | When set to `false` (as is default) URLs will be auto-converted into links, conversation names will be link-ified, and certain mentions will be [automatically parsed](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting#automatic-parsing). When set to `true`, Slack will continue to process all markdown formatting and [manual parsing strings](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting#advanced), but it won’t modify any plain-text content. For example, channel names will not be hyperlinked. This field is only usable when `type` is `mrkdwn`.  
#### Example[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#text__example)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#text__example)
```
{
  "type": "mrkdwn",
  "text": "A message *with some bold text* and _some italicized text_."
}
