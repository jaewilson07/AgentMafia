For information about private channels, refer to [conversation objects](https://api.slack.com/types/conversation). The [Conversations API](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api) will tell you whether a conversation is private or not with the `is_private` boolean field.
For posterity, a group object contains information about a private channel that was created before March 2021. The private channel's ID will begin with `G`, as private channels were previously known as "private groups."
An example response is below:

Field | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`id` | string | The ID of the private channel.  
`name` | string | The name of the private channel.  
`is_group` | boolean | Whether this object is a conversation.  
`created` | Unix timestamp | When the conversation was created.  
`creator` | string | The user ID of the member that created this private channel.  
`is_archived` | boolean | `true` if the private channel is archived.  
`is_mpim` | boolean | Whether a multiparty instant message (`mpim`) is being emulated as a private channel. For compatibility with older clients, `mpims` can appear as private channels unless `rtm.start` is called with `mpim_aware=1`.  
`members` | array | A list of user IDs for all users in this private channel. This includes any disabled accounts that were in this private channel when they were disabled.  
`topic` | object | The topic of the conversation.  
`purpose` | object | The purpose of the conversation.  
Some API methods (such as [conversations.create](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.create)) will include extra state information for channels when the calling user is a member:
  * `last_read`: the Unix timestamp for the last message the calling user has read in this channel.
  * `unread_count`: a full count of visible messages that the calling user has yet to read.
  * `unread_count_display`: a count of messages that the calling user has yet to read that matter to them (this means it excludes things like join/leave messages).
  * `latest`: the latest message in the channel.
