Block elements can be added to certain [app surfaces](https://api.slack.com/surfaces) and used within certain [block types](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks).
#### Interactive components [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#interactive-components)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#interactive-components)
Interactive components are block elements that add interactivity. All block elements are interactive components except for one: the static _image_ element. Our [handling user interactivity guide](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling) will help you prepare your app to use interactive components.
#### Making an element optional [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#element-optional)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#element-optional)
To make any block element optional, you can contain that element within an [input block](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#input), and use its `optional` field to designate the element as an optional one.
## Elements [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#elements)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#elements)
This page lists the JSON payloads that your app can use to generate each element. Select the block element you'd like to build:

Example:

### Fields[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#button__fields)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#button__fields)
Field | Type | Description | Required?  
---|---|---|---  
`type` | String | The type of element. In this case `type` is always `button`. | Yes  
`text` | Object | A [text object](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#text) that defines the button's text. Can only be of `type: plain_text`. `text` may truncate with ~30 characters. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 75 characters. | Yes  
`action_id` | String | An identifier for this action. You can use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads). Should be unique among all other `action_id`s in the containing block. Maximum length is 255 characters. | No  
`url` | String | A URL to load in the user's browser when the button is clicked. Maximum length is 3000 characters. If you're using `url`, you'll still receive an [interaction payload](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads) and will need to [send an acknowledgement response](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#acknowledgment_response). | No  
`value` | String | The value to send along with the [interaction payload](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads). Maximum length is 2000 characters. | No  
`style` | String | Decorates buttons with alternative visual color schemes. Use this option with restraint.`primary` gives buttons a green outline and text, ideal for affirmation or confirmation actions. `primary` should only be used for one button within a set.`danger` gives buttons a red outline and text, and should be used when the action is destructive. Use `danger` even more sparingly than `primary`.If you don't include this field, the default button style will be used. | No  
`confirm` | Object | A [confirm object](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#confirm) that defines an optional confirmation dialog after the button is clicked. | No  
`accessibility_label` | String | A label for longer descriptive text about a button element. This label will be read out by screen readers _instead of_ the button [`text`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#text) object. Maximum length is 75 characters. | No  
### Examples[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#button__examples)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#button__examples)
A regular interactive button:
```
{
 "type": "button",
 "text": {
  "type": "plain_text",
  "text": "Click Me"
 },
 "value": "click_me_123",
 "action_id": "button"
}

```

A button with a `primary` `style` attribute:
```
{
 "type": "button",
 "text": {
  "type": "plain_text",
  "text": "Save"
 },
 "style": "primary",
 "value": "click_me_123",
 "action_id": "button"
}

```

A link button:
```
{
 "type": "button",
 "text": {
  "type": "plain_text",
  "text": "Link Button"
 },
 "url": "https://api.slack.com/block-kit"
}

```

## Datetime picker element [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#datetimepicker)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#datetimepicker)
**Allows users to select both a date and a time of day, formatted as a Unix timestamp.**
_Interactive component_ - see our [guide to enabling interactivity](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling).
On desktop clients, the time picker will take the form of a dropdown list and the date picker will take the form of a dropdown calendar. Both options will have free-text entry for precise choices. On mobile clients, the time picker and date picker will use native UIs.

### External data source [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_multi_select)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_multi_select)
This menu will load its options from an external data source, allowing for a dynamic list of options.
#### Setup[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_multi_select__setup)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_multi_select__setup)
To use this menu type, you'll need to configure your app first:
  1. Go to your [app's settings page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select **Interactivity & Shortcuts** from the sidebar.
  2. Add a URL to the **Options Load URL** under Select Menus.
  3. Save changes.


Each time a menu of this type is opened or the user starts typing in the typeahead field, we'll send a request to your specified URL. Your app should return an HTTP 200 OK response, along with an `application/json` post body with an object containing either:
  * an [`options`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#option) array
  * an [`option_groups`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#option_group) array


The `option_groups` array can have a maximum number of 100 option groups with a maximum of 100 options.
Here's an example response:
```
{
 "options": [
  {
   "text": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
   },
   "value": "value-0"
  },
  {
   "text": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
   },
   "value": "value-1"
  },
  {
   "text": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
   },
   "value": "value-2"
  }
 ]
}

```

#### Making the element optional [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#multi-select-optional)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#multi-select-optional)
By default, external multi-select menu elements require a user to select at least one option from the drop-down menu. However, there is a way to make a selection from this element optional. This is done by containing the element within an [input block](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#input), and using its `optional` field to designate the input element as an optional element. (In fact, any Block Kit element can be made optional this way!)
#### Fields[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_multi_select__fields)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_multi_select__fields)
Field | Type | Description | Required?  
---|---|---|---  
`type` | String | The type of element. In this case `type` is always `multi_external_select`. | Yes

The default value is `3`. | No  
`initial_options` | Object[] | An array of [option objects](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/composition-objects#option) that exactly match one or more of the options within `options` or `option_groups`. These options will be selected when the menu initially loads. | No  
`confirm` | Object | A [confirm object](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/composition-objects#confirm) that defines an optional confirmation dialog that appears before the multi-select choices are submitted. | No  
`max_selected_items` | Integer | Specifies the maximum number of items that can be selected in the menu. Minimum number is 1. | No  
`focus_on_load` | Boolean | Indicates whether the element will be set to auto focus within the [`view object`](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/views). Only one element can be set to `true`. Defaults to `false`. | No  
`placeholder` | Object | A [`plain_text`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#text) only text object that defines the placeholder text shown on the menu. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 150 characters. | No

## Overflow menu element [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#overflow)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#overflow)
**Allows users to press a button to view a list of options.**
_Interactive component_ - see our [guide to enabling interactivity](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling).
Unlike the select menu, there is no typeahead field, and the button always appears with an ellipsis ("…") rather than customizable text. As such, it is usually used if you want a more compact layout than a select menu, or to supply a list of less visually important actions after a row of buttons. You can also specify URL links as overflow menu options, instead of actions.

### Select menu of external data source [](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_select)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_select)
This select menu will load its options from an external data source, allowing for a dynamic list of options.
#### Setup[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_select__setup)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#external_select__setup)
If you don't have [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) enabled, you'll need to configure your app to use this menu type:
  1. Go to your [app's settings page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select **Interactivity & Shortcuts** from the sidebar.
  2. Add a URL to the **Options Load URL** under Select Menus.
  3. Save changes.


Each time a select menu of this type is opened or the user starts typing in the typeahead field, we'll send a request to your specified URL. Your app should return an HTTP 200 OK response, along with an `application/json` post body with an object containing either:
  * an [`options`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#option) array
  * an [`option_groups`](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#option_group) array


The `options` array can have a maximum number of 100 options.
The `option_groups` array can have a maximum number of 100 option groups, with each option group allowing up to 100 options.
Here's an example response:
```
{
 "options": [
  {
   "text": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
   },
   "value": "value-0"
  },
  {
   "text": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
   },
   "value": "value-1"

    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
   },
   "value": "value-2"
  }
 ]
}

### Fields[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#workflow_button__fields)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#workflow_button__fields)
Field | Type | Description | Required?  
---|---|---|---  
`type` | String | The type of element. In this case `type` is always `workflow_button`. | Yes  
`text` | Object | A [text object](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#text) that defines the button's text. Can only be of `type: plain_text`. `text` may truncate with ~30 characters. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 75 characters. | Yes  
`workflow` | Object | A [workflow object](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#workflow) that contains details about the workflow that will run when the button is clicked. | Yes  
`action_id` | String | An identifier for the action. Use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#payloads). Every `action_id` in a block should be unique. Maximum length is 255 characters. | Yes  
`style` | String | Decorates buttons with alternative visual color schemes. Use this option with restraint.`primary` gives buttons a green outline and text, ideal for affirmation or confirmation actions. `primary` should only be used for one button within a set.`danger` gives buttons a red outline and text, and should be used when the action is destructive. Use `danger` even more sparingly than `primary`.If you don't include this field, the default button style will be used. | No  
`accessibility_label` | String | A label for longer descriptive text about a button element. This label will be read out by screen readers _instead of_ the button [`text` object](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/composition-objects#text). Maximum length is 75 characters. | No
