API object type
# conversation
[View other types](https://api.slack.com/types)
A conversation object contains information about a channel-like thing in Slack. It might be a public channel, a private channel, a direct message, a multi-person direct message, or a huddle. You'll find all of these objects throughout the [Conversations API](https://api.slack.com/docs/conversations-api). Different fields are included in the object payload depending on the type of conversation (channel, DM, MPIM, etc.). The legacy objects—[channel](https://api.slack.com/types/channel), [group](https://api.slack.com/types/group), [im](https://api.slack.com/types/im), and [mpim](https://api.slack.com/types/mpim)—reference pages are nested under this one for posterity, but they are all now represented by the conversation object.

## Conversation-related booleans [](https://api.slack.com/types/conversation#booleans)[](https://api.slack.com/types/conversation#booleans)
Property | Description  
---|---  
`is_archived` | Indicates a conversation is archived, frozen in time.  
`is_channel` | Indicates whether a conversation is a channel. Private channels created before March 2021 (with IDs that begin with `G`) will return `false`, and `is_group` will be `true` instead. Use `is_private` to determine whether a channel is private or public.  
`is_ext_shared` | Indicates whether a conversation is part of a [Shared Channel](https://api.slack.com/shared-channels) with a remote organization. Your app should make sure the data it shares in such a channel is appropriate for both workspaces. `is_shared` will also be `true`.  
`is_general` | Means the channel is the workspace's "general" discussion channel (even if it may not be named `#general`). That might be important to your app because almost every user is a member.  
`is_group` | Means the channel is a private channel created before March 2021. `is_private` will also be `true`.  
`is_im` | Means the conversation is a direct message between two distinguished individuals or a user and a bot. `is_private` will also be `true`.  
`is_member` | Indicates whether the user, bot user or Slack app associated with the token making the API call is itself a member of the conversation.  
`is_mpim` | Represents an unnamed private conversation between multiple users. `is_private` will also be `true`.  
`is_org_shared` | Indicates whether this shared channel is shared between [Enterprise Grid](https://api.slack.com/enterprise-grid) workspaces within the same organization. It's a little different from (_externally_) [Shared Channels](https://api.slack.com/shared-channels), yet `is_shared` will be `true`.  
`is_pending_ext_shared` | Means the conversation is ready to become an `is_ext_shared` channel, but needs some kind of approval or sign off first. Best to treat it as if it were a shared channel, even if it traverses only one workspace.  
`is_private` | Means the conversation is privileged between two or more members. Ensure that you meet their privacy expectations.  
`is_read_only` | Means the conversation can't be written to by the user performing the API call.  
`is_shared` | Means the conversation is in some way shared between multiple workspaces. Look for `is_ext_shared` and `is_org_shared` to learn which kind it is, and if that matters, act accordingly.  
`is_thread_only` | Means the conversation can't be written to by the user performing the API call, except to reply to messages in the channel.  
`num_members` | The number of members in the conversation. `num_members` may not make an appearance in the response for conversation types like DMs, where the number of members is constant.  
## Other conversation-related attributes [](https://api.slack.com/types/conversation#other-attributes)[](https://api.slack.com/types/conversation#other-attributes)
Property | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`name` | String | Indicates the name of the channel-like thing, without a leading hash sign. Don't get too attached to that name; it may change — instead, when working with channel-like things, focus on their IDs, their type, and the team/workspace they belong to.  
`creator` | String | The ID of the member that created this conversation.  
`created` | Int | Timestamp of when the conversation was created.  
`conversation_host_id` | String | Appears on shared channel objects and indicates the "host" of the shared channel. The value may contain a workspace's ID (beginning with `T`) _or_ an Enterprise Grid organization's ID (beginning with `E`).  
`topic` | String | Provides information about the channel topic.  
`purpose` | String | Provides information about the channel purpose.  
`updated` | Int | The timestamp, in milliseconds, when the channel settings were updated — for example, the "topic" or "description" of the channel changed.  
Some API methods; for example, [`conversations.join`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.join), can include extra state information for channels when the calling user is a member:
Property | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`last_read` | Int | The timestamp for the last message the calling user has read in this channel.  
`unread_count` | Int | A full count of visible messages that the calling user has yet to read.  
`unread_count_display` | Int | A count of messages that the calling user has yet to read that matter to them (excludes things like join/leave messages).  
`latest` | String | The latest message in the channel.  
`properties` | Object | Additional channel properties (see below).  
The `properties` object contains many additional fields that appear based on the context of the object.
Property | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`posting_restricted_to` | Object | An object comprised of three arrays: `subteam`, `type`, and `user`, each offering a different way to restrict who can post in the channel.  
`threads_restricted_to` | Object | An object comprised of three arrays: `subteam`, `type`, and `user`, each offering a different way to restrict who can post in threads in the channel.  
`at_channel_restricted` | Boolean | Indicates if the `@channel` mention is restricted.  
`at_here_restricted` | Boolean | Indicates if the `@here` mention is restricted.  
`huddles_restricted` | Boolean | Indicates if huddles are restricted.  
`sharing_disabled` | Boolean | Indicates if sharing is disabled.  
`canvas` | Object | The channel canvas.  
`record_channel` | Object | Properties for SFDC Record channels.  
`crm` | Object | Properties for Slack CRM.  
`worklfow` | Object | Properties for a workflow; currently contains one field, `primary_workflow_url`.  
`tabs` | Object | List of channel tabs. Each tab has an `id`, `label`, `type`, `data`, and `is_disabled` property. Its `type` can be any of the following: `list`, `canvas`, `files`, `bookmarks`, `folder`, `pins`, `workflows`, `channel_canvas`, `record_list`, `record_overview`, `record_summary`, `record_related_list`,`salesforce_list_view`.  
`huddles` | Object | Properties for huddles for the channel the huddle occurred in.  
`membership_limit` | Integer | Limit of users in channel.  
`channel_workflows` | Array | An array of workflows in the channel.  
`channel_solutions` | Object | Properties for channel solutions: `workflow_trigger_ids`, `workflow_workflow_ids`, `canvas_ids`, `list_ids`.  
`default_tab_id` | String | Indicates which tab in the channel is the default.  
`auto_open_tab_id` | String | Indicates which tab in the channel auto opens.  
`meeting_notes` | Object | Properties for channel meeting notes.  
These channel objects are not the same object type as those for private channels created before March 2021, which are considered [group objects](https://api.slack.com/types/group).
