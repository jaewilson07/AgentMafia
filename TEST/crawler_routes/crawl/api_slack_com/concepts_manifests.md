# App manifests
App manifests are `YAML` or `JSON` files that contain the configuration for [Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/start/apps) and [workflow automations](https://api.slack.com/automation).
➡️ For non-workflow apps, [the app manifest](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests) can help you quickly create, configure, and copy Slack apps. You can share and reuse these manifests. Use this capability to create development clones of production apps.
➡️ For workflow automation apps, [the manifest](https://api.slack.com/automation/manifest) holds the details of your app’s configuration, declaring the custom types, steps, workflows, and more that the automation contains.
## Manifest concepts [](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#concepts)[](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#concepts)
All apps have a manifest. Manifests are reusable configurations; they are designed to make an app's configuration "portable". You can store a manifest in version control such as GitHub where collaborators can easily grasp the setup of your app. Manifests can also make testing easier for apps that have the same setup.
Manifests are expressed in `JSON` or `YAML` and can be authored in your app's configuration page. The [Deno SDK](https://api.slack.com/automation/deno/install) provides additional tooling for authoring manifests in the language of the framework.
➡️ If you are developing with the Deno SDK, use the required reference fields on the [workflow apps manifest page](https://api.slack.com/automation/manifest) for your source of truth.
Currently, there are two versions of app manifests. [Workflow automations](https://api.slack.com/automation) exclusively use version 2, while [Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/start/apps) may use either version. If the `version _metadata` property is not specified, Slack will treat your manifest configuration as v1. The [properties](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#fields) outlined below indicate which manifest version they are included in.
### Manifests for non-workflow apps[](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#concepts__manifests-for-non-workflow-apps)[](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#concepts__manifests-for-non-workflow-apps)
App manifests be created and managed by visiting [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), selecting the app, then navigating to **Features** > **App Manifest** or directly by using the [App Manifest API](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests#manifest_apis).
When you create an app through [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) using the **Create New App** button, you have an option to create from scratch or from an existing app manifest. This is how you could replicate a manifest from another app, pasting the recycled manifest there.

### Manifests and the Deno SDK[](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#concepts__manifests-and-the-deno-sdk)[](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#concepts__manifests-and-the-deno-sdk)
For [workflow automation apps](https://api.slack.com/automation) created with the Deno SDK, keep your local `manifest.ts` or `manifest.js` file up-to-date with any custom types, steps, datastores, and workflows required for your app.
✨ Read more on the [App manifest page](https://api.slack.com/automation/manifest) for workflow apps page.
## Manifest schema [](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#fields)[](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#fields)
Manifests are written in YAML or JSON using a specific structure. Deno Slack SDK enables writing manifests in TypeScript. Here is an example of what one might look like in each language.

### Functions [](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#functions)[](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests#functions)
The function settings should be used to create custom workflow steps available for use in workflows either defined in the manifest or built directly in Workflow Builder.
The function property is a map, where the keys are the `callback_id` of the step. This `callback_id` can be any string, and is used to identify the individual steps in order to refer to them like `functions.<callback_id>`. Each step in the map contains all properties listed below.
Field | Description | Required | v1 | v2  
---|---|---|---|---  
`functions.<callback_id>` | A unique string identifier in snake_case format representing the step; max 100 characters. No other steps in your application should share a callback ID. Changing a step's callback ID is not recommended, as the step will be removed from the app and created under the new callback ID, breaking anything referencing the old step. | No | ✅ | ✅  
`functions.<callback_id>.title` | A string to identify the step; max 255 characters. | Yes (for each step included) | ✅ | ✅  
`functions.<callback_id>.description` | A succinct summary of what your step does. | Yes (for each step included) | ✅ | ✅  
`functions.<callback_id>.input_parameters` | An object which describes one or more input parameters that will be available to your step. Each top-level property of this object defines the name of one input parameter available to your step. See details regarding structure below. | Yes (for each step included) | ✅ | ✅  
`functions.<callback_id>.output_parameters` | An object which describes one or more output parameters that will be returned by your step. Each top-level property of this object defines the name of one output parameter your step makes available. See details regarding structure below. | Yes (for each step included) | ✅ | ✅  
The schema structure of `input_parameters` and `output_parameters` differs between version 1 and 2 of the app manifest. In version 1, `input_parameters` and `output_parameters` contain a list of parameters, with each parameter containing an `is_required` field, such that the structure looks like this:
```
functions:
 prep_ingredients:
  title: Prepare ingredients
  description: Runs sample function
  input_parameters:
   user_id:
    type: slack#/types/user_id
    title: User
    description: Message recipient
    is_required: true
    hint: Select a user in the workspace
    name: user_id
  output_parameters:
   user_id:
    type: slack#/types/user_id
    title: User
    description: User that completed the function
    is_required: true
    name: user_id

```

Whereas in the version 2 manifest, `input_parameters` and `output_parameters` contain a `properties` argument in which the parameters are nested alongside a `required` field denoting which properties are required. The structure looks like this:
```
functions:
 prep_ingredients:
  title: Prepare ingredients
  description: Runs sample function
  input_parameters:
   properties:
    user_id:
     type: slack#/types/user_id
     title: User
     description: Message recipient
     hint: Select a user in the workspace
     name: user_id
   required: { user_id }
  output_parameters:
   properties:
    user_id:
     type: slack#/types/user_id
     title: User
     description: User that completed the function
     name: user_id
   required: { user_id }

```
