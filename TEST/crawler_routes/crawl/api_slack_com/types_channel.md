API object type
# channel
[View other types](https://api.slack.com/types)
A channel object is a legacy object that contains information about a workspace channel. These channel objects are not the same object type as private channels, which are considered [group objects](https://api.slack.com/types/group). Channels and groups are now considered a type of [conversation](https://api.slack.com/types/conversation).
Field | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
`id` | string | The channel ID.  
`name` | string | Indicates the name of the channel-like thing, without a leading hash sign. Don't get too attached to that name. It might change. Don't even bother storing it. When thinking about channel-like things, think about their IDs, their type, and the team/workspace they belong to.  
`is_channel` | boolean | Indicates if it is a channel.  
`created` | Unix timestamp | Timestamp of when the channel was created.  
`creator` | string | The user ID of the member that created the channel.  
`is_archived` | boolean | `true` if the channel is archived.  
`is_general` | boolean | `true` if this channel is the "general" channel that includes all regular members. In most workspaces this is called `#general`, but some workspaces have renamed it.  
`name_normalized` | string | A normalized string of the name.  
`is_shared` | boolean | `true` if the channel is shared.  
`is_org_shared` | boolean | Indicates if the organization which the channel belongs to is shared.  
`is_member` | boolean | `true` if the calling member is part of the channel.  
`is_private` | boolean | Indicates if the channel is private.  
`is_mpim` | boolean | Indicates if the channel is a multi-party instant message.  
`last_read` | Unix timestamp | The timestamp for the last message the calling user has read in this channel.  
`latest` | object | The latest message in the channel.  
`unread_count` | integer | A full count of visible messages that the calling user has yet to read.  
`unread_count_display` | integer | A count of messages that the calling user has yet to read that matter to them (this means it excludes things like join/leave messages).  
`members` | array | A list of user IDs for all users in this channel. This includes any disabled accounts that were in this channel when they were disabled.  
`topic` | object | The topic of the channel.  
`purpose` | object | The purpose of the channel.  
`previous_names` | array | A list of prior names the channel has used.
