The Slack Conversations API provides you with a unified interface to work with all the channel-like things encountered in Slack: public channels, private channels, direct messages, group direct messages, [shared channels](https://api.slack.com/shared-channels), and so on.
Use this [API family](https://api.slack.com/methods#conversations) to [review history](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.history), [create](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.create) or [archive](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.archive) channels, [invite](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.invite) team members, [set conversation topics](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.setTopic) and [purpose](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.setPurpose), and more — no matter what type of conversation you're working with.
The types of channels you interface with in the Conversations API are governed by corresponding [permission scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes). For example; to retrieve details about a public channel, you'll need [`channels:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read). For details about a private channel, you'll need [`groups:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/groups:read).
## Using the Conversations API [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#conversations_api)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#conversations_api)
Before the Conversations API, you needed to use different methods from multiple "family trees" to achieve the same thing depending on the _type_ of channel you were working with.
For example, to list direct messages you had to call the `im.list` method, but for public channels you had to call the `channels.list` method. Many different objects and shapes represented the same type of timeline message container at their core. These methods are now [deprecated](https://api.slack.com/apis/changelog/2020-01-deprecating-antecedents-to-the-conversations-api).
In the new model, use `conversations.*` methods to access anything channel-like. For example, the [`conversation.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) method returns information on public, private, and direct message channels, when accessed with the appropriate [permission scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes).

## Working with Shared Channels [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#shared_channels)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#shared_channels)
Each channel has a unique-to-the-team ID that begins with a single letter prefix: either `C`, `G`, or `D`.
When a channel is shared across teams (see [Slack Connect: working with channels between organizations](https://api.slack.com/shared-channels)), the prefix of the channel ID may be changed, e.g. a private channel with ID `G0987654321` may become ID `C0987654321`.
This is one reason you should use the `conversations` methods instead of the previous API methods! You cannot rely on a private shared channel's unique ID remaining constant during its entire lifetime.
The channel type object tells you additional channel information. If the channel is shared, `is_shared` is set to `true`. If it is a private channel or a group DM channel, the properties `is_private` or `is_mpim` are set to `true`.
### The conversational booleans [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#booleans)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#booleans)
Some of the most important fields in [conversation objects](https://api.slack.com/types/conversation) are the booleans indicating what kind of conversation/channel it is and how private it is. For a list of these booleans, refer to [conversation-related booleans](https://api.slack.com/types/conversation#booleans).
## Conversation membership [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#membership)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#membership)
Discover who is party to a conversation with [`conversations.members`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.members), a paginated method allowing you to safely navigate through very large (or tiny) collections of users.
## Permission scopes [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#permission_scopes)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#permission_scopes)
Your app's scopes act as a filter. They sort out the conversations you don't have access to, guaranteeing that Conversations API methods only return the conversations your app should see.
### Scopes for classic apps [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#classic_app_scopes)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#classic_app_scopes)
All Conversations API endpoints still accept _multiple_ scopes and filter access to channels based on the provided token's scope. If you have a scope that allowed you to use a deprecated conversation method, that scope will work with the Conversations API equivalent.
For instance, [`conversations.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) accepts [`channels:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read), [`groups:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/groups:read), [`mpim:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/mpim:read), and [`im:read`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/im:read).
If you only have `channels:read`, then `conversations.list` will only return public channels and all the related methods will only deal with public channels. If you have both `channels:read` and `im:read`, then methods will only return public channels and DMs, and so on.
### Scopes for workspace apps (deprecated) [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#workspace_app_scopes)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#workspace_app_scopes)
Workspace apps were [retired in August 2021](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2021-03-workspace-apps-to-retire-in-august-2021).
## Pagination [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#pagination)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#pagination)
The Conversations API uses our [cursor-based pagination model](https://api.slack.com/docs/pagination), improving the performance of requests over large sets of data.
Just set a `limit` on your first request, include the `next_cursor` found in `response_metadata` in the response as the `cursor` parameter in your next request and you're paginating with ease on the conversational trapeze. Unlike older methods, the Conversations API is paginated _by default_.
### Inconsistent page size is a feature, not a bug[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#pagination__inconsistent-page-size-is-a-feature-not-a-bug)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#pagination__inconsistent-page-size-is-a-feature-not-a-bug)
Keep in mind that it's possible to receive fewer results than your specified `limit`, even when there are additional results to retrieve. Maybe you'll even receive 0 results but still have a `next_cursor` with 4 more waiting in the wings.
When looking up MPIMs using the `conversations.list`, you are likely to get far fewer results than requested number with a `next_cursor` value, although `next_cursor` will continue to indicate when more results await. For example, when requesting 100 MPIMs, it may return only 5.
## Known issues [](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues)
#### 🚧 Channel IDs can become unstable in certain situations[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues__-channel-ids-can-become-unstable-in-certain-situations)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues__-channel-ids-can-become-unstable-in-certain-situations)
There are a few circumstances where channel IDs might change within a workspace. You can use [`conversations.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) regularly to monitor change for known `#channel` names if ID stability is important to you.
In the future, we'll mitigate this unexpected transition with appropriate [Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api) events or other solutions.
#### 🚧 MPIM events and channel types[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues__-mpim-events-and-channel-types)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues__-mpim-events-and-channel-types)
In a Multiparty Direct Message Channel (MPIM) with a foreign user, events like [`member_joined_channel`](https://api.slack.com/events/member_joined_channel) and [`member_left_channel`](https://api.slack.com/events/member_left_channel) may dispatch an incorrect value for `channel_type`.
#### 🚧 IM object format is not yet consistent[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues__-im-object-format-is-not-yet-consistent)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues__-im-object-format-is-not-yet-consistent)
IM formats may differ from other channel objects. We're working towards making all objects the same format. You may notice `members` lists that aren't meant to be there. These are almost all cleared up!
#### 🚧 Unsharing channels[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues__-unsharing-channels)[](https://api.slack.com/apis/conversations-api#issues__-unsharing-channels)
When a channel becomes unshared, [`conversations.history`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.history) access for the channel may become unreliable.
