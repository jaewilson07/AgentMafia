Sign in with Slack links is a paid feature. Interested parties should fill out the [interest form](https://api.slack.com/siwsl/interest) or reach out to [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/partnersupport@slack-corp.com)partnersupport@slack-corp.com for more information.
The Sign in With Slack (SIWS) link, built on the [OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), allows a user to share their Slack information with you when they click on a link from your service. This can happen without your app being installed in a workspace.
There are two Sign in with Slack entry points:
  * A user clicks on a link in Slack and is forwarded to you with identity info in the URL, giving you the option of dealing with the user without having to ask them to approve access.
  * A user pastes a link from your domain in Slack's composer and wants to activate the [Unfurl Preview](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#unfurl_previews).


Once you receive the user’s information you can decide whether to create an account, redirect them to the resource they initially clicked on, or implement another flow that makes sense for you.
See this [guide](https://api.slack.com/authentication/configuring-siwsl) on configuring Sign in with Slack links using Auth0.
## Prerequisites [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#prerequisites)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#prerequisites)
  * You have a Slack app using [granular permissions](https://api.slack.com/quickstart).
  * You have implemented [Sign in with Slack using OpenID Connect](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack).
  * You have [migrated](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack#migrate) any existing legacy implementation using `identity.*` scopes.


## Creating a test app [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#test-app)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#test-app)
In order to properly utilize SIWS entry points you will need to provide Slack with the following:
  * The domain to enable. This must be a different domain than your production domain for testing and building.
  * The dev `app_id` you want to use to build on Sign in with Slack links.
  * The team `name` or `id` where the app lives, to enable it for Domain Verification.
  * Any team names or ids you want to use to test the feature.
  * The dev URL where you want us to send users after they click on an SIWS link.


Then complete the following steps for your app:
  1. Add the following user scopes to your app setup in Slack.
     * [`openid`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/openid)
     * [`email`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/email)
     * [`profile`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/profile)
  2. Enable public distribution. This is required for using an OAuth flow. You do not need to actually publicly distribute your app.
  3. Add a background color and icon under the **Basic Information** tab.
  4. Add a privacy URL under the **Basic Information** tab.
  5. Add a ToS URL under the **Submit to Slack Marketplace** tab: “Security & Compliance Section” > “General” > “Terms of Service URL”.
  6. Follow the Domain Verification steps under **Settings** in your App dashboard. The prompt will look similar to the following:


![SIWS Modal](https://a.slack-edge.com/086d9d1/img/api/siws/siws_modal.png)
If the user clicks **Skip** , we will redirect to the link clicked. If a user declines three times, they will no longer see the prompt.
## Identity transfer [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#id_transfer)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#id_transfer)
When a user clicks on an Sign in with Slack link in Slack, they will be redirected to the URL you provided along with the parameter, `login_hint`; a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/). This will contain a base64 encoded value with 3 parts:
  * The **Header** is used to determine how to verify the signature. It will always contain: `json "Header": { "alg": "RS256", "typ": "JWT" }`
  * The **Payload** will contain all the info you need to understand who the user is that clicked on the link.
  * The **Signature** should be verified using the implementation or service of your choice.


When you receive the payload from an Sign in with Slack link it will look like:
```
{
  "iss": "https://slack.com",
  "sub": "test@slack-corp.com",
  "aud": "533193414769.1727340817111",
  "exp": 1614211080,
  "iat": 1614210780,
  "auth_time": 1614210780,
  "https://slack.com/user_id": "W123ABC456",
  "https://slack.com/team_id": "T123ABC456",
  "https://slack.com/target_uri": "https://grask.me/testing"
}

```

The `https://slack.com/target_uri` is the URL that the user initially clicked on in Slack (or the URL to return to Slack if coming from [Composer auth](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#composer_auth)). Use this URL to redirect the user.
When you receive the payload from calling the `openid.connect.token` endpoint there will be different data:
```
{
  "ok": "true",
  "access_token": "xoxp-...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "id_token": {
  "iss": "https://slack.com",

}

```

### Storing user data [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#storing-data)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#storing-data)
You can choose which fields of this payload to store as you associate the Slack user identity to a user of your service. We recommend at a minimum storing `email`, `sub` or `user_id`, `name`, and `access_token`.
The `access_token` will serve to unlock some pre-installation platform features of your app.
## `links.accountLinkedResult` [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#metrics)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#metrics)
After a user has gone through the OIDC flow, send the results to a Slack hosted endpoint. This endpoint should be called on every OIDC identity exchange (every time the user clicks on an identity link or uses the Sign in with Slack social login button).
You can call the endpoint with the token you receive during the OIDC flow:
```
curl -X POST \
   https://slack.com/api/links.accountLinkedResult \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer xoxp-....' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8' \
   -d '{
      "team_id":"T123ABC456",
      "user_id":"U123ABC456",
      "result": "NEW_ACCOUNT_CREATED",
      "source": "IDENTITY_LINKS",
   }'

```

Parameter | Description | Format  
---|---|---  
`user_id` | The Slack `user_id` returned during OIDC. | `U123ABC456`  
`team_id` | The `team_id` returned during OIDC. | `T123ABC456`  
`result` | Action taken by partner system every time user goes through OIDC. See below. | One of `NEW_ACCOUNT_CREATED`, `UNLINKED_ACCOUNT_LINKED`, `LINKED_ACCOUNT_LOGGED_IN`, `IGNORED_DUE_TO_EXISTING_SESSION`, `ERROR_DETECTED`  
`source` | Initiation source for OIDC exchange. | One of `SOCIAL_LOGIN`, `IDENTITY_LINKS`.  
The `result` parameter:
Value | Description  
---|---  
`NEW_ACCOUNT_CREATED` | A new account was created and linked to a Slack identity, and the user was logged into that account.  
`UNLINKED_ACCOUNT_LINKED` | The user was logged into an existing unlinked account which was linked for the first time.  
`LINKED_ACCOUNT_LOGGED_IN` | The user was logged into an account that was previously linked.  
`IGNORED_DUE_TO_EXISTING_SESSION` | An existing session was found, and no action was taken as a result.  
`ERROR_DETECTED` | Any detectable error in the flow, either because of Slack or your service, that prevents one of the other results from being reached.  
## Magic unfurls [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#magic_unfurl)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#magic_unfurl)
If you are interested in magic unfurls with Sign in with Slack Links, please reach out to [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/partnersupport@slack-corp.com)partnersupport@slack-corp.com to be enabled.
In addition to prompting Sign in with Slack when a link gets clicked, you can trigger a SIWS link flow when a user shares a link in the message composer. Once the user agrees to transfer their identity, your app will get permission to unfurl rich previews for links shared by the user in Slack, even if the app is not installed in the workspace yet.
Once the link unfurl is posted, any user can click it and trigger SIWS.
There are two additional app requirements to use magic unfurls:
  * Subscribe to the [`link_shared`](https://api.slack.com/events/link_shared) event.
  * Set your verfied domain as the app unfurl domain in the **Event Subscription** of your app settings.


### Composer auth [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#composer_auth)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#composer_auth)
When a user pastes a link into their message, if Slack doesn't detect that they've already shared their identity with your app through SIWS links, they will see a prompt under the message composition prompting them to activate the link preview.
![Composer Auth prompt](https://a.slack-edge.com/a83f056/img/api/partner_docs/composer_auth.png)
After they click the prompt, they will see a modal asking if they would like to grant permission to transfer their Slack identity and activate link previews.
If the user clicks **Accept** , it will initiate an identity transfer using OpenID Connect to your site. This is similar to what happens when a user clicks on a Sign in with Slack link, but instead of redirecting to the link clicked at the end of the flow, your site will redirect back to a Slack URL which will take the user back into Slack.
After you store the association between the Slack user (including their `access_token`) and the existing user of your service, your app should redirect to the URI defined in the key `https://slack.com/target_uri` which should bring the user back into Slack. You'll also receive the key `https://slack.com/resource_uri`, which includes the link the user pasted in the composer.
### Unfurl previews [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#unfurl_previews)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#unfurl_previews)
A `link_shared` event with `"source": "composer"` will be dispatched to your service in the following cases:
  * Shortly after your app redirects the user to Slack after Composer auth account linking.
  * After a user, that has already accepted the SIWS modal, pastes a link from your domain into the composer.
  * After a user, that has your full app installed in their workspace with app unfurls enabled, pastes a link from your domain into the composer.


The event structure will be:
```
{
  "token": "XXYYZZ",
  "team_id": "T123ABC456",
  "api_app_id": "A123ABC456",
  "event": {
    "type": "link_shared",
    "user": "U123ABC456",
    "channel_id": "COMPOSER",
    "message_ts": "gryl3kb80b3wm49ihzoo35fyqoq08n2y",
    "unfurl_id": "gryl3kb80b3wm49ihzoo35fyqoq08n2y",
    "source": "composer",
    "links": [
      {
        "domain": "example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com/12345"
      },
      {
        "domain": "example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com/67890"
      },
      {
        "domain": "another-example.com",
        "url": "https://yet.another-example.com/v/abcde"
      }
    ]
  },
  "type": "event_callback",
  "authed_users": [
    "U123ABC456",
    "U222222222"
  ],
  "event_id": "Ev123ABC456",
  "event_time": 123456789
}

```

Unlike existing app unfurl `link_shared` events, There won't be a `message_ts`, and potentially not a `channel_id` yet. It is possible to compose a message that does not (yet) contain this context.
To ensure backwards compatibility, the `channel_id` will always be set to the value `"COMPOSER"`. The `unfurl_id` property serves as the unique identifier for an unfurl. The `message_ts` property will be set to the same value as `unfurl_id`.
The `source` property indicates where this unfurl is coming from. Its value can be either `composer` (for previews) or `conversations_history` (for posted messages).
Your app then calls `chat.unfurl` using the stored corresponding user token for the user who sent the link (or bot token if the app is installed) with the contents of the unfurl, including the `unfurl_id` and `source` (or alternatively the `channel_id` & `ts`):

}

```

The Slack client will update the message composition with a preview of the unfurl. The contents of the preview are pulled from the preview key if present, otherwise the preview will be generated from the existing blocks layout or legacy attachment. The app name and icon are retrieved from your Slack Marketplace listing.
See below for an example:
![Unfurl Preview](https://a.slack-edge.com/a83f056/img/api/partner_docs/unfurl_preview.png)
The user can click on this preview to show a full preview of what the unfurl will look like, pulled from the blocks key. Any included interactive elements will not be usable.
![Unfurl Preview Full Message](https://a.slack-edge.com/a83f056/img/api/partner_docs/unfurl_preview_full.png)
## Pre-install unfurls [](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#preinstall-unfurls)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#preinstall-unfurls)
The user has an option to remove the unfurl while composing the message, but if they leave it in and hit send, a second `link_shared` event will be dispatched to your app, providing the `channel` and `message_ts` context:
```
{
  "token": "XXYYZZ",
  "team_id": "T123ABC456",
  "api_app_id": "A123ABC456",
  "event": {
    "type": "link_shared",
    "channel": "C123ABC456",
    "is_bot_user_member": false,
    "user": "U123ABC456",
    "message_ts": "123452389.9875",
    "unfurl_id": "gryl3kb80b3wm49ihzoo35fyqoq08n2y",
    "source": "conversations_history",
    "links": [
      {
        "domain": "example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com/12345"
      },
      {
        "domain": "example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com/67890"
      },
      {
        "domain": "another-example.com",
        "url": "https://yet.another-example.com/v/abcde"
      }
    ]
  },
  "type": "event_callback",
  "authed_users": [
    "U123ABC456",
    "U222222222"
  ],
  "event_id": "Ev123ABC456",
  "event_time": 123456789
}

```

A `"source": "conversations_history"` property and an `unfurl_id` (different from the `unfurl_id` received for the preview event) property will be included. Use the `team_id` and `user` information to look up the corresponding user token (or bot token if installed), then call `chat.unfurl` using the `unfurl_id` and `source` properties.
This will result in the unfurl appearing in the Slack channel attached to the message:
![Unfurl Pre-Install](https://a.slack-edge.com/a83f056/img/api/partner_docs/unfurl_preinstall.png)
#### Interactive Block Kit elements in pre-install unfurls[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#preinstall-unfurls__interactive-block-kit-elements-in-pre-install-unfurls)[](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack-links#preinstall-unfurls__interactive-block-kit-elements-in-pre-install-unfurls)
When interactive elements are included in the pre-install unfurl there are some limitations:
  * Only actions based on `trigger_id` will be allowed, you will not receive a `response_url`.
  * If unauthenticated users (those who haven't accepted the SIWS modal) click on an interactive element, they will see an error and immediately trigger the modal. If they accept and successfully complete the flow (the `redirect_uri` will be `https://slack.com/openid/connect/complete/interactivity/{unique_key}` ), the user will have to click the element again for the app to successfully receive an event and clear the error.

Utilize the `apps.links.toggle` endpoint to enable or disable the SIWS links feature. This POST request requires two arguments:
Field | Description  
---|---  
`token` | An app level token to verify the app and the required scope permissions. Requires the [`app_configurations:write`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/app_configurations:write) scope. Can be found by going to the "Basic Information" with the app settings page. It'll be listed under "App Level Token".  
`status` | Accepts `enable` or `disable` in order to determine if the feature is enabled.  
You can provide the token argument as the Bearer Token.
