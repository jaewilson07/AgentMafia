Today is the day! As [previously mentioned](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2024-12-api-site-migration), the Slack platform and developer tools documentation are moving: the shiny new Slack platform documentation is now in beta on [docs.slack.dev](https://docs.slack.dev/), and the developer tools documentation has fully moved to its new home on [tools.slack.dev](https://tools.slack.dev/). The doors are open for our housewarming party 🥳 so come on in, take a look around, and let us know what you think. Thanks for coming along on this journey with us! 
Feb 27, 2025
Version `3.0.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is here, with lots of goodies for you! 
We renamed the `slack.json` file to `.slack/hooks.json`, and continue to support `slack.json` for existing projects. There is now a warning shown in `--verbose` output to encourage projects to migrate their `slack.json` to `.slack/hooks.json.`
We've removed the `invalid_app_directory` error from any commands run in nested project directories, and now search for the required `slack.json` file in the project's configuration. We also now also check for this file at `.slack/hooks.json`.
We now cache the last known manifest export; the cache is used to avoid overwriting changes on app settings. If the manifest is changed on app settings since the last update, a confirmation prompt will appear before making another update via the Slack CLI.
We've moved the top-level commands you know and love, `slack create` and `slack samples`, to be sub-commands of the `slack project` command (they remain aliased as top-level commands though, so there is no change to the user experience).
We've updated the `slack doctor` command to display the `manifest.source` value, which will be either `local` or `remote`.
We now officially support Bolt for JavaScript and Bolt for Python in the Slack CLI! 🎉 
As such, we've updated the `slack create` command with a new create journey that allows you to choose between different types of apps for Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, and Deno.
We've also added the `slack init` command, which will initialize an existing Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, or Deno project with Slack CLI support.
We fixed a bug to avoid confusion with regular outputs, and now prefix all separate debug logs with a timestamp.
We fixed a bug to avoid spinning the spinner when outputting with debug logs, or if styles are removed with the `--no-color` flag.
We fixed a bug to now display uninstalled apps in selections when using the `slack collaborators` and `slack manifest` commands.
We fixed a bug with confirming trusted templates that are from a Slack GitHub organization.
We fixed a bug regarding writing console outputs to activity logs during local runs.
We fixed a bug where the Slack CLI would get stuck if one of the goroutines of the `slack run` command encountered an error; we now exit the `slack run` command if this happens.

Feb 27, 2025
We [previously](https://api.slack.com/changelog#entry-december_2023_0) mentioned that we had deprecated the `deno` command and removed its listing from the `help` command. We have now removed the `deno` command completely. Developers who were depending on this command should now use the deno executable directly. We've also removed support for the deprecated, pre-release Deno Slack SDK versions that used `slack.yaml` and `project.ts` files. The Run-on-Slack platform no longer supports the `slack.yaml` file format, and no production projects should be affected. The `project.ts` file was deprecated by the Deno Slack SDK in favor of `manifest.ts` and `manifest.json` files. 
Feb 13, 2025
Version `2.33.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform will be your valentine! 
We now support running CLI commands in project sub-directories.
We've enhanced the script and outputs of hooks to improve debugging.
We've fixed a bug to properly output error messages that may occur when the `slack manifest` command is run.
We've fixed a bug to distinguish between Slack CLI names if your Slack CLI is named something other than `slack`.

Feb 3, 2025
A new [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) block is now available for use! The [markdown block](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#markdown) accepts standard markdown and outputs formatted Slack markdown; intended for use in [AI apps](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps/ai). 
Jan 30, 2025
The Data Access API is here! This API is now available in a limited release for interested partners. Use the [Data Access API](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps/data-access-api) within AI apps to access all the relevant Slack data you need to ensure a pleasant user experience for AI apps.
