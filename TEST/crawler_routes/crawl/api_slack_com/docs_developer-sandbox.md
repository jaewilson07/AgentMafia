Developer sandboxes are Enterprise Grid environments that can be used to build against all of Slack's features both safely and securely, and without an additional cost. The ability to provision sandboxes is a benefit offered by the [Slack Developer Program](https://api.slack.com/developer-program).
Ready to join? Follow the steps below!
## 1. Sign up for a developer account [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sign-up)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sign-up)
  1. Navigate to the [Slack Developer Program](https://api.slack.com/developer-program) page. Click **Join the Program**.
  2. Fill out the registration form and click **Submit**.
  3. You'll receive an email confirmation to activate your account. Click **Activate Developer Account** from the email; you'll then be redirected to a sign-in page.
  4. Sign in using the email address you provided on the registration form.
  5. Click **I Agree** to accept the Terms of Service.


Observe the welcome screen — you'll also receive a welcome email. Welcome to the Slack Developer Program! 🎉
Once your account is created and you're logged in, you'll be able to access your developer [Dashboard](https://api.slack.com/developer-program/dashboard). This dashboard features the latest development-related happenings at Slack, and is updated regularly.
## 2. Provision a sandbox [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#provision)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#provision)
To provision a sandbox, navigate to **Sandboxes** and click **Provision Sandbox**.
If you are not a member of a paid plan (the paid plan workspace must have been created at least 30 days ago, unless you're on Enterprise Grid), you'll be prompted to provide a payment method, but note that you will not be charged.
Enter the details for your sandbox and click **Provision Sandbox** again. Once created, your provisioned sandbox will appear below on the [Sandboxes](https://api.slack.com/developer-program/sandboxes) page.
To access your newly-provisioned sandbox, click its name and log in with your email address and the password you just created. Once you complete verification, your Sandboxes page will show a workspace with the same name as your sandbox.
Click **Launch in Slack**. Your workspace will show the following:
  * Two channels
  * Two workspace members (including you)


Your sandbox has been provisioned successfully. Happy building! 🏖️
### Sandbox statuses [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#statuses)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#statuses)
A sandbox can have one of the following statuses:
  * **Active** : Active sandboxes have a default lifespan of six months. As long as you are still eligible to provision sandboxes, you can extend the lifespan of the active sandbox to another six months, every six months.
  * **Archived** : Once a sandbox reaches the end of its lifespan, it will be automatically archived. Once archived, all users (including you as the admin and owner of the sandbox) will no longer be able to access it. 
    * You will receive an email reminding you that your sandbox will be archived 30 days before the sandbox reaches the end of its lifespan.
    * All data will be retained for a three month grace period after the sandbox is archived, except for messages and files based on the [limits](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#limits) below. Workflows cannot be executed once the sandbox is archived, including scheduled and webhook workflows.
    * During the grace period, you can choose to unarchive the sandbox; however, the rest of the users in the sandbox must be reactivated via the sandbox Enterprise Management panel.
    * If you lose your eligibility, your sandboxes will be automatically archived within 30 days. If you regain eligibility, you can extend the lifespan of the sandbox.
    * After the grace period, the sandbox will be automatically deleted.
  * **Deleted** : Once you delete a sandbox, all data including messages, files, workflows, and users will be irretrievable.


### Sandbox limits [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#limits)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#limits)
Sandboxes have the following limits:
  * **Grid creation/count limits** : 
    * You can provision up to 10 sandboxes over the course of 30 days.
    * You can have up to two active sandboxes at any given time.
    * A sandbox is active for six months, by default.
  * **Workspace creation/count limits** : 
    * A sandbox can contain up to three full-featured workspaces. There are no limits on the number of total workspace creations.
  * **User limits** : 
    * Max eight users per sandbox. This includes owners and admins, but excludes bots and apps.
    * Max two guests per sandbox (single-channel or multi-channel).

## FAQs [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#faqs)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#faqs)
### What is a developer sandbox? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-what)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-what)
As part of the [Slack Developer Program](https://api.slack.com/developer-program), you'll get access to an Enterprise Grid sandbox that allows you to explore all features, including automations. You'll also get early access to betas, and can develop and test apps and workflows in a dedicated, fully-featured development environment.
### How are developer sandboxes intended to be used? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-use)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-use)
Developer sandboxes are intended to be used for development and application testing purposes.
### Who can sign up for a Slack Developer Program account, and what costs are associated with membership? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#dev-account)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#dev-account)
Anyone can sign up for an account, and there are no costs associated with being a member of the Slack Developer Program. [Sign up](https://api.slack.com/developer-program/join) today!
### Who can create a developer sandbox? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-who)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-who)
Any developer enrolled in the Slack Developer Program can provision or delete a developer sandbox. However, in order to provision a sandbox, you must either be on a paid plan already, or you must provide a valid payment method for the account.
### Are developer sandboxes available to developers without a paid plan? Why is a payment method required for provisioning? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#payment)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#payment)
Yes. The payment method is used for identity verification purposes only; you will not be charged.
### How do Enterprise sandboxes work? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#enterprise-sandboxes)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#enterprise-sandboxes)
If you belong to an Enterprise organization and your Org Admin has enabled **Allow developer sandboxes > Require approval for sandbox provisioning** within your organization's settings, you'll need to make a request before you can provision a sandbox.
The steps for provisioning a sandbox will remain much the same, except that you can enter an optional reason for your request. After you click **Request Access** , your request will be submitted to your Org Admin.
Your Org Admin will review your request and, if approved, you'll receive a Slackbot notification that you can go ahead and provision your sandbox. If they deny your request or they have disabled sandbox provisioning for your organization, you'll see the relevant message displayed on both your Dashboard and Sandboxes pages.
Your Org Admin also has the ability to manage the sandbox you create—they can choose to archive it, extend its archive date, or delete it. You'll receive Slackbot notifications when any of these actions are taken.
#### Developer sandboxes for Enterprise admins[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#enterprise-sandboxes__developer-sandboxes-for-enterprise-admins)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#enterprise-sandboxes__developer-sandboxes-for-enterprise-admins)
If you are an Org Admin, once a developer within your organization submits a request to create a sandbox, you will receive a Slackbot notification to approve or deny the request. You may also configure default actions for incoming sandbox requests rather than having to review and manage requests one by one.
In addition, you can restrict who can join developer sandboxes with an allowlist of email domains (e.g., only users with a .com email address will be allowed to join a sandbox). You can also restrict Slack Connect channels in a sandbox to sandboxes only owned by your organization, or allow sandboxes to connect to your organization via Slack Connect.
### What features and limitations are applicable to developer sandboxes? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-limits)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-limits)
Developer sandboxes are Enterprise Grid environments and offer the same features included with all [Enterprise Grid plans](https://app.slack.com/plans/), but with limitations imposed upon those features. Refer to [sandbox limits](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#limits) for more details.
### Do developer sandboxes have access to the information, data, or settings in my parent enterprise or in workspaces under the same domain? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-access)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-access)
No. Each developer sandbox is distinct and has no connection to any other workspace that shares a common domain name.
### How many sandboxes can I create and how long do they last? [](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-status)[](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#sandboxes-status)
You can provision up to 10 sandboxes over the course of 30 days, and you can have up to two active sandboxes at any given time. Sandboxes are active for six months by default. Refer to [sandbox limits](https://api.slack.com/docs/developer-sandbox#limits) for more details. As long as you are still eligible to provision sandboxes, you can extend the lifespan of the active sandbox to another six months, every six months.
