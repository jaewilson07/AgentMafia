# Reference: View interaction payloads
There are different types of payloads that can be received when users interact with [modal views](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals#views):
  * [`view_submission`](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission)
  * [`view_closed`](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_closed)


## `view_submission` payloads [](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission)
Sent to an app's [configured Request URL](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#setup) when a user submits a [view in a modal](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals#views).
Read [our guide to using modals](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#handling_submissions) to learn how your app should process and respond to these payloads.
If you're using our Bolt SDKs, we have additional guidance on how to utilize the `view_submission` payload:
  * [Bolt JS](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/concepts#view-submissions)
  * [Bolt Python](https://slack.dev/bolt-python/concepts#view-submissions)
  * [Bolt Java](https://slack.dev/java-slack-sdk/guides/modals)


### Properties [](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission_fields)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission_fields)
This is a list of some properties that can be encountered in this type of interaction payload:
Properties received in a `view_submission` event may differ based on the source of the interactive elements. A check in the column means that property is included in a `view_submission` event sent to a function, a non-function, or both. Functions refer to [workflow apps](https://api.slack.com/automation/interactivity).
Property | Functions | Non-Functions | Description | Required?  
---|---|---|---|---  
`type` | ✓ | ✓ | Identifies the source of the payload. The `type` for this interaction is `view_submission`. | Yes  
`team` | ✓ | ✓ | The [workspace](https://api.slack.com/methods/team.info) where the view was submitted from. Null if the app is org-installed. | Yes  
`user` | ✓ | ✓ | The user who interacted to trigger this request. | Yes  
`view` | ✓ | ✓ | The source [view](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals#views) of the modal the user submitted. | Yes  
`enterprise` | ✓ | ✓ | The enterprise that the installed app is a part of, if the app is either workspace-installed on an org, or org-installed. | Yes  
`api_app_id` | ✓ | ✓ | A string representing the app ID. | Yes  
`function_data` | ✓ | Metadata about the function execution that generated the view where this view submission took place. | Yes  
`interactivity` | ✓ | An interactivity object generated as a result of the view submission. | Yes  
`bot_access_token` | ✓ | A workflow (just-in-time) token generated for this view submission. | Yes  
`view.state.values` | ✓ | ✓ | A dictionary of objects. Each object represents a block in the source view that contained [stateful, interactive components](https://api.slack.com/messaging). Objects are keyed by the `block_id` of those blocks. These objects each contain a child object. The child object is keyed by the `action_id` of the interactive element in the block. This final child object will contain the `type` and submitted `value` of the input block element. | No  
`hash` | ✓ | ✓ | A unique value that is optionally accepted in [`views.update`](https://api.slack.com/methods/views.update) and [`views.publish`](https://api.slack.com/methods/views.publish) API calls. When provided to those APIs, the `hash` is validated such that only the most recent view can be updated. This should be used to ensure the correct view is being updated when updates are happening asynchronously. | No  
`response_urls` | ✓ | (Deprecated for workflow apps) An array of objects that contain `response_url` values, used to [send message responses](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#message_responses). Each object will also contain `block_id` and `action_id` values to identify the source of the interaction. Also included is a `channel_id` which identifies where the `response_url` will publish to. `response_urls` is available only when the view contained block elements configured to generate a [response_url](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#modal_response_url). | No  
### Example [](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission_example)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission_example)
This is an example `view_submission` payload:
```
{
 "type": "view_submission",
 "team": { ... },
 "user": { ... },
 "view": {
  "id": "VNHU13V36",
  "type": "modal",
  "title": { ... },
  "submit": { ... },
  "blocks": [ ... ],
  "private_metadata": "shhh-its-secret",
  "callback_id": "modal-with-inputs",
  "state": {
   "values": {
    "multiline": {
     "mlvalue": {
      "type": "plain_text_input",
      "value": "This is my example inputted value"
     }
    },
    "target_channel": {
     "target_select": {
      "type": "conversations_select",
      "selected_conversation": "C123B12DE"
     }
    }
   }
  },
  "hash": "156663117.cd33ad1f",
  "response_urls": [
   {
    "block_id": "target_channel",
    "action_id": "target_select",
    "channel_id": "C123B12DE",
    "response_url": "https:\/\/hooks.slack.com\/app\/ABC12312\/1234567890\/A100B100C100d100"
   }
  ]
 }
}

```

This was generated from the submission of this example view:
```
"view": {
 "type": "modal",
 "callback_id": "modal-with-inputs",
 "title": {
  "type": "plain_text",
  "text": "Modal with inputs"
 },
 "blocks": [
  {
   "type": "input",
   "block_id": "multiline",
   "label": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "Enter your value"
   },
   "element": {
    "type": "plain_text_input",
    "multiline": true,
    "action_id": "mlvalue"
   }
  },
  {
   "block_id": "target_channel",
   "type": "input",
   "optional": true,
   "label": {
    "type": "plain_text",
    "text": "Select a channel to post the result on",
   },
   "element": {
    "action_id": "target_select",
    "type": "conversations_select",
    "response_url_enabled": true,
   },
  }
 ],
 "submit": {
  "type": "plain_text",
  "text": "Submit"
 }
}

```

## `view_closed` payloads [](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_closed)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_closed)
Optionally sent to an app's [configured Request URL](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#setup) when a user dismisses a [modal](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals). To receive these payloads, the modal view must [have been created](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#composing_views) with the [`notify_on_close` argument set to `true`](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/views#reference-guide-defining-view-objects__fields).
Read [our guide to using modals](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals/using#modal_cancellations) to learn how your app should process and respond to these payloads.
### Fields[](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_closed__fields)[](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_closed__fields)
Field | Description  
---|---

`user` | The user who dismissed a modal to trigger this request.  
`view` | The source [modal view](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals#views) that the user dismissed. This will include the full state of the view, excluding any [input blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#input) in the modal.
