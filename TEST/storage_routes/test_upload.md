# Executive Summary

IT departments have invested heavily in people and systems to  get closer to the fundamental goal of unlocking the right data,  at the right time, for the right people. But to date, businesses  have been forced to cobble together disparate efforts, with no  single solution able to deliver the combination of functionality,  security, and ease of use required to bring data efficiently to  everyone within an organization. This paper explores what  makes Domo’s solution different, how it solves common  challenges faced by IT departments, and how Domo offers a  data strategy built for enterprise but designed for people.

Learn how Domo:

- Functions as much more than just another BI or visualization tool. + Complements, rather than threatens, your existing infrastructure and systems. + Brings trusted security, risk mitigation, and governance to your data and people. + Offers several implementation options to find the best cost value fit and trade-off for your unique situation.

- Provides extensibility, agility, and scale that grows with your business, coupled with an efficiency that prevents unnecessary duplication of data.

In short, Domo understands not just data but also the daily  people and culture challenges faced by IT departments.  The amount of data that needs to be managed continues to  increase but so do pressures to reduce costs and become  more efficient. Read on to see how Domo can help IT create a  digitally connected organization that fosters innovation while  also bringing advanced governance and security.

# Why Domo Matters in  Today’s Landscape

## The Growth of Shadow IT

It’s no secret that data continues to grow exponentially yet IT budgets have remained relatively  flat. This dichotomy of growing data but stagnant resources creates frustration with scale,  integration, and adoption. Meanwhile, marketing clouds, sales clouds, and HR clouds have  emerged to capture divisional budgets and decrease the storage costs of legacy on-premises  systems. Unfortunately, they often start as shadow IT and result in complex siloed systems that  hinder wide user adoption, are complicated to maintain, and pose additional security complications.

## The Limitations of Data Warehouses and Data Lakes

Many enterprises still rely on data warehouses to store structured data from each department  in hierarchical folders, and data warehouses can still be useful for production applications that  require especially tight security. But the explosion of data has put pressure on traditional  warehouses. Few warehouses are suited to manage the ever-expanding variety and volume of  data in today’s environment. A data warehouse is simply too expensive and inflexible to scale  with emerging demands.

Data lakes attempt to address these issues by making infrastructure more agile, enabling IT  leaders to maintain a single source of raw data, and providing multiple versions of specialized  exports. However, while data lakes can house very large amounts of data in a cost-effective  manner, they are not generally built for query speed. Even basic joins can be very slow. It is great  to have all the data in one place, but it is hard to get it out efficiently when you have to rely on  scarce engineering resources or expensive data scientists.

Moreover, a data lake is often built before first determining the best ways to fill it and structure  it. When a data lake is designed as one entity rather than partitioned to address different types  of use cases, it can easily turn from a lake into a swamp of stagnant and ignored information.  Domo’s flexible infrastructure supports incremental evolution of the data lake to assure maxi mum utility. Domo Connectors and Domo Workbench help pull data in from legacy systems while  the data lake is setup. Once the data lake contains the new required data, the data in Domo can  be swapped to the new source by direct upload or by taking the federated caching approach  documented below. The end user in the business does not have to change tools or even know  that back end systems have changed.

## Domo as a Data Mart to Augment Existing Investment

As enterprises deal with complicated governance across their tech stack, IT leadership is  more important than ever. Many have found traction in this digital transformation by taking  advantage of Domo’s differentiated fit as a rapid prototyping data mart to quickly test  what is useful enough to justify inclusion in the data lake. Domo’s approach saves costs by  consolidating systems across connection, transformation, and visualization that formerly  required separate contracts and maintenance.

![](images/image1.png)

Instead of a rip-and-replace solution, Domo can be used as a highly flexible data mart that  functions as a capstone overlay to your current systems. Domo builds on the strong foundation  you’ve already created, letting you leverage your current architecture by safely extending access  and significantly improving adoption of IT investments across the whole company.

## Fueling Exploration with a Data Mart Approach

We also know that not every single business problem requires or warrants data being added to  your data lake. Domo connectors help with areas that are of smaller importance or outside the  core of the data lake scope. Domo’s intuitive interface is easily adopted by users across all  departments and helps accelerate innovation and experimentation. While helping proactive  individuals become more agile, Domo still respects the need for administrative control.  Personalized data permissions deliver fast answers while limiting access of sensitive data to  authorized users. In this way, Domo can prove the usefulness of new data that should be added to  the data lake, help eliminate data that would not be useful in the lake, and help define prioritization.

Because it is intuitive enough to be used by knowledge workers in every department, Domo grows  faster than any other data mart. Business users can quickly automate imports from formerly  scattered systems and build independence in final mile business intelligence while IT refocuses  on more strategic initiatives. By showing the flow of data across all systems within your estab lished data lake, Domo helps IT leaders root out shadow IT and prevent rogue data sets from  propagating in silos. Governance finally becomes realistic as IT leaders gain the control they need.

# How Domo Connects  and Stores Your Data

## Simplify Data Access for Critical Decisions

Connect is Domo’s bi-directional framework that includes over 500 full-scale proprietary  plug-and-play connectors. Users in any department can easily bring in data whether it resides in  the cloud, on-premises, or in local files. Domo can easily ingest multi-billion row datasets across  high bandwidth connections. This eliminates the time-consuming and costly processes of  building and maintaining data connections with internal engineering resources. Data automatically  updates so you can track time-sensitive trends and see performance unfold in real time.

![](images/image3.png)![](images/image2.png)For businesses that have spent billions of dollars on legacy on-premise data centers, or ones that  are in highly-regulated industries with data like PII and PHI that need special handling, Domo’s

open data platform can be used either as an organization’s primary data store or as an  augmentation to its existing stack.

IT leaders can also take advantage of the web-based toolkit called Connector Dev Studio which  allows clients to customize connectors.

# How Domo Connects  and Stores Your Data

## Expand on Existing Feeds with the API

Users that prefer to bypass Domo’s connectors for some of their data can upload via the Domo  API and Java command line interface (CLI). These robust developer tools help more advanced  teams pull or push data programmatically. The multi-part API breaks multi-billion row updates  into many small segments for simultaneous processing. This high-bandwidth ingestion option  accelerates time to value and reduces switching costs no matter how large the initial import is.

![](images/image11.png)The CLI can process data so quickly that IT no longer has to feel forced through a single data  pipeline path. Choose whether a direct or hybrid path best fits your use case and Domo  can adapt.

## Expand Storage for the Endless Influx of Data

Adrenaline is Domo’s intelligent data warehouse with sub-second response even for high  volumes of concurrent queries. Domo uses a massively scalable parallel processing query engine  that can handle any amount and any frequency of data—the only limitation comes from the  original source system. Moreover, Domo uses durable storage and

redundant systems to provide the best possible experience to end

users. This open data framework gives IT multiple options for importing

and exporting information. Management, metadata, and record-level

data governance are universally provided, no matter what the

proprietary source and format of data. This frees IT from cumbersome

modeling requirements. While Domo can easily ingest multi-billion row datasets, you never need  to worry about duplication of or unnecessary replication of your data. Management of federated  queries gives IT explicit control of every table that can be accessed

by Domo.

## Simplify Storage Logistics with Federated Agents

Domo embraces a variety of enterprise IT approaches to data management. Customers have  several options from full hosting in Domo, exclusive storage in the client’s data lake, or a hybrid  blend of both. Adrenaline’s data engine provides highly indexed and available data without the  need to constantly summarize and cube. Still, if there are parts of your data lake you would not  want to replicate, federated agents can create a cached version of the detailed raw data in your lake.

This federated approach solves data residency issues between the Domo cloud and your  on-premise data stores as the data remains within your lake but is accessible by Domo cards,  apps, and visualizations. The query is sent directly to your lake and translated from DQL (Domo  Query Language) to the SQL format of your current database technology. This can still be used in  conjunction with Adrenaline to ensure speed of most common queries while federated is used  for more complex views without having to worry about the logistics of duplicating large data sets.  Client-side machines can serve data for multiple adapters. Top database management  technologies like AWS, SQL Server, MySQL, and Crossdata are supported. Pending support is  being developed for Couchbase, Teradata, and Hadoop. New federated adapters are available  upon request. Dynamic load-balancing supports redundancy since the federated service code can  detect all the client-side agents. The federated service then redistributes queries based on what is  most active and is likely to respond fastest.

Many Domo customers configure a bi-directional integration with their existing data lake so that  Domo can expand connections to the systems business users want most. Other customers use  Domo connectors for internal systems too, effectively creating their data lake in Domo. The rest  take a hybrid approach as Domo starts as a data mart that grows faster than any other because  of its speed, scale, security, and simplicity. All three approaches help IT departments realize great

er value from their past investments.

# Efficiency Plus Security

## Keeping IT in Control

Efficient storage and queries only matter if they are accompanied by top-level security. Domo  brings governance and security that you can trust no matter what the scenario. Within our  federated approach, for instance, a cache of the most recent queries is stored only long enough  to render visualizations during a customizable time to live. Time to live settings can also be  overridden with an immediate kill switch to flush the cache across all queries. This can actually  lower AWS costs by managing what gets placed in real time hot storage vs. long-term cold storage.

At rest, customer data in Domo is ephemeral. Only the sub-set of customer data that is queried  by the customer is passed temporarily to Domo. TTL (Time to live) associated with all customer  data can be configured by the customer to be as short as milliseconds. Once the TTL expires  after processing it is immediately deleted from  ![](images/image10.png)

memory. Customers can totally disable data ac

cess and delete all customer data in the Domo

cloud anytime. Smart caching ensures repetitive

requests do not hit the DB again as long as they

are made within the TTL.

Persistent socket connections minimize traffic

to avoid issues with latency that otherwise would have occurred due to re-establishing the TCP  connection for each request. The client has full control. They determine which connections to  initiate, which data to share, and how long to maintain the time to live. ![](images/image15.png)

This protects data in all  stages of its lifecycle.

Customer firewalls control all inbound and out

bound traffic in-transit. All traffic is encrypted with

strong authentication to ensure system integrity.

Federated clients are managed by the customer

within their own data center to regulate every

action. This gives security experts the assurance

they need to govern what is accessible to those

external connections. IT can enforce detailed

limits so Domo can only query approved tables.

![](images/image13.png)

## Securely Share Data at Scale to Multiple Subscribers

All of the scale that Domo offers comes with granular row

level control for access entitlements. Every dataset can

have an infinite number of permission policies that can all

be managed via API. Further enhance Domo governance

controls with Publish, which can be used to mirror portions of content from a master parent  instance to any number of fully separated subscribers.

The subscriber instances have unique login portals to prevent any chance of access to restricted  data. Activity across all subscribers can be tracked within the Domo Publish page of the parent  instance. This is especially useful for IT teams that must manage sharing for multiple customers  and partners.

![](images/image7.png)

## Secure Sensitive Data with Complete Confidence

Over 32% of the Fortune 50 Global companies (including many of the largest organization in  the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia) are served by the Domo cloud. Domo has built the Business  Cloud platform to meet the enterprise security, compliance, and privacy requirements of our  customers in highly regulated industries, such as financial services, health care, pharmaceuticals,  government, energy, and technology providers.

To ensure the requirements of customers and regulators are met, Domo completes numerous  audits, assessments and compliance requirements—including rigorous third-party network and  system penetration tests.

![](images/image5.png)

Domo’s enterprise-grade cloud architecture protects your most sensitive and confidential data,  even in highly-regulated verticals, like financial services and healthcare. The Domo Trust program  covers all your security, compliance, and privacy controls, offering 2FA, SSO, event logging, and  shared encryption keys that keep IT in control. Customers can control access down to individual  row of data through Personal Data Permissions (PDP).

Strict segmentation is enforced with unique identifiers for all data and dedicated table  spaces. This is supported by multiple security layers, least privilege policies, and separation of  duty models, threat assessments of each new feature, transport layer encryption, encryption at  rest, customers management their own encryption keys, and extensive logging of system events.

## Encryption ![](images/image8.png)

In transit, all interaction is forced through HTTPS and

TLS. Workbench uses the same API calls that Domo web

browser interface uses. Both require outbound TCP port

443 from the client’s office. Public connectors, such as

weather service data, may not be encrypted in transit if the

data provider does not make encryption options available.

All other connectors use encryption by default. At rest, all

data is immediately encrypted and stored in Vault for persistence, backup, and redundancy. It is  replicated across multiple redundant locations and transmission of the backup is also encrypted.

## Retention

Domo retains multiple versions of data. Most is kept for a year, while other types remain for up to  seven years. Domo will delete client data from our systems within 90 days of agreement  termination or upon valid customer request. This includes all backups and archives.

Disaster recovery plans are in line with industry continuity standards and are updated annually  according to frequent SOC 2 tests. Domo does not distribute specific details as it contains cus tomer contact information and other protected data.

## Location

Domo is primarily deployed in the US East region of AWS. Domo’s platform is deployed across  multiple zones within the region for availability purposes. We also offer hosting in the Dublin and  Sydney AWS regions. Any activity outside of the US is optional, based on client need.  Other regions may be available in the future and utilized to comply with customer regulation  requirements.

In addition to AWS, Domo utilizes Equinix as another US-based data center provider. Domo leases  cage space separate from other Equinix customers, and we own and manage all the hardware  associated with our clients’ data. Cybage is the 24x7x365 Network Operations Center service  provider. Both organizations may have incidental access to customer data in supporting Domo’s  operational needs but are not provided direct access to customer data. Domo conducts third  party vendor assessments and annual security reviews of these vendors in-line with industry  leading practices.

## BYOK ![](images/image4.png)

Bring Your Own Key provides peace of mind by giving IT

complete control of the encryption keys. This helps IT

ensure data is always kept private, even from Domo. Cus

tomers can revoke the encryption key at any time with an

instant kill switch that nullifies data access so sensitive data

is safe.

Domo BYOK is the first of its kind for enterprise cloud security in business intelligence.  It’s designed to let each customer manage their own cloud instance in accordance with internal  security and compliance requirements. Domo BYOK provides the ability to rotate the encryption  keys numerous times a day. Through this customer-controlled encryption, customers can revoke  encryption keys at any time, nullifying all data in Domo, and making it so no one will have access  to their sensitive customer data. With Domo BYOK, customers are always in complete control of  their data.

Specific fields or columns can be protected by a pre-shared key or a password.  The BYOK kill  switch allows 2 people to simultaneously approve deletion of the cache. Domo only receives the  encrypted data and never accesses the customer key. Since Domo cannot decrypt the data  without customer permission, clients control the distribution of the key to their users.

## SAML-based SSO

Enterprises that use identity providers can configure Domo as the endpoint URL and upload an  x.509 certificate to control access based on predefined user groups.

![](images/image6.png)![](images/image12.png)

## Multi-Factor Authentication

Login credential storage is salted with a SHA 512 hash in the CyberArk password management  system. Any support services team member who needs access to a credential must be pre-au thorized. Internal specialists authenticate with their individual user account and a valid business  justification for change control, troubleshooting, scaling, or availability. All business justifications  are logged and reviewed daily by Information Security. Weekly reports detailing access are sent to  the client services management for review.

## User Types

Creating users and granting access rights in Domo is the first layer in maintaining information  security. Profiles either grant and/or restrict access to the specific data and apps in Domo. For  ease of deployment, pre-defined security profile options include Administrator, Privileged, Editor,  and Participant. Each profile contains clearly defined access privileges which can be turned on or  off by default. Role privileges can be fully tailored to align with your unique policies.

## Personalized Data Permissions

Authorized users can create robust entitlement policies that govern access to specific data in a  data set for individuals or groups. With PDP, you can tailor data access permissions for each  specific user, increasing data usage while simultaneously ensuring that sensitive information  remains secure.

![](images/image14.png)

## Log Monitoring

Administrators can easily monitor global activity across Domo with the Domo-provided Activity  Logs console. One can quickly access usage metrics like login attempts, card views, card creation,  and card edits. The console also provides the times those events took place and by which user.  Admins can filter and sort this data, and export to an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file.

# Expand on New Data  Opportunities

## Standardize Formatting for Consistent Reliability

Fusion is Domo’s data transformation engine that ensures all data

speaks the same language. Fusion’s native data manipulation tools en

able any connected dataset to be cleansed, combined and prepared

without any outside ETL technologies. Domo’s Magic ETL enables less

experienced business users to format data from any source, with no

coding or SQL expertise required.

Fusion’s predictive algorithms and

customizable code blocks unlock the

tremendous value of data science. For

example, data from marketing automation and web analytics can

be transformed through drag and drop flows to uncover insights,

perform calculations, and maintain accuracy. More advanced users

still have the option to write, edit, and validate SQL queries in

Domo Data Flows.

When imported data needs cleansing, standardization, or aggrega

tion, scripts can be refined directly within Domo to transform data

without having to switch back and forth between niche tools. Experts comfortable with MySQL  or Redshift will feel right at home coding a sub-select or join in Domo’s SQL editor to leverage its  scalable resources.

## Drive Adoption with an Intuitive Interface for

Self-Serve Data Exploration

While great for data science work and engineered solutions, most BI

tools are too complicated for adoption by common business users.

Domo’s Explorer provides a user-friendly interface to visualize data

from your data lake. Ad hoc exploration is intuitive enough that any

business user can build and share real-time stories anywhere from

board meetings to weekly updates. This frees up data scientists to focus on truly advanced  analytics and makes data exploration intuitive for others across the business.

Business leaders need access everywhere they work, so Domo

makes it easy to build once and interact anywhere with support for

every device across mobile and desktop. SMS text alerts with mo

bile views are aligned with email alerts and desktop drill downs so

you can adapt everything from executive overviews through analyst

exploration workspaces.

## Mobile-first Means Build Once and Be Done

Every card built in Domo is automatically mobile-optimized

for whatever device you’re viewing it on, so you’ll never need

to create or maintain a separate mobile version.

The fully-interactive mobile experience gives users access to

live business data and all the tools needed to explore, drill,

analyze, annotate, and comment on any device. Add critical

context to your data with annotations drawn right on a chart

to ask questions, call out anomalies, and sync automatically

across all devices.

## Use Your Own Visualization Tools with ODBC

ODBC allows more advanced users to query any Domo dataset like a  common database table via HTTPS. It requires a Client ID and Client

Secret for authentication.

Then analytics specialists can continue to use any visualization

platform or on-premises system they prefer for ad hoc data explora

tion while the majority of business users use Domo for intuitive data  interaction on any device.

## Show Content in the Context of Internal Applications

Bypass the Domo Interface with Embed. For example, a call center application may pull in  customer profile cards from Domo. Business users want faster, more relevant data located  in the tools, sites, and applications they already use. Domo Everywhere  securely shares insights with customers, partners and vendors in

portals, web properties, or applications.

Once embedded, any parameters applied to a card can be reflected

in the embedded report. User access can also be controlled by using  personalized data permissions to pass parameters back to Domo.

## Break Down Silos with Collaboration in Context

Buzz is the integrated productivity tool for collaboration around important insights. Text messaging, video chat, sharing, and annotations foster a curiosity and puts qualitative information around quantitative data. Teams and individuals can share real-time data from any source,

create team channels, and assign projects and tasks from within any

conversation—all done quickly and securely.

Now everyone can share and collaborate around business

data as a natural, organic part of the discussion. And it’s easily

accessible from any screen in Domo, including mobile. Buzz is

available for free to every employee, and gives business users

one platform to use with co-workers, teams, departments,

and across organizations.

## Leverage Algorithms for  Actionable Automation

Mr. Roboto leverages machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics that

constantly scan incoming data to detect anomalies, identify correlations, and provide alerts.

This AI layer sits at the convergence of all the data and user activities in Domo. This offers increased alignment, accuracy and effectiveness so that business decision makers can gain a holistic view of their data to take more informed actions.

In addition to predictive alerts sent via Buzz, Domo’s powerful data science tools can help users  get more out of their data investment. By combining tools such as anomaly detection, personal  data consumption patterns, trending focus points and more, Domo intelligently surfaces key  insights and anomalies for optimizing core business functions and predicting key challenges in  performance.

## Manage by exception with predictive alerts

Get notified via email, mobile push notifications, or text  when the business needs your attention. Focus on proac

tive optimization while there’s still time to make an impact.

Avoid noise by scheduling alerts for any frequency you  prefer. Time-based alerts also help you to set measurable  pacing goals and then be alerted when the progress you  expect is not on track.

For more advanced data scientists, R and Python integrations provide the flexibility they need to interact with their  models natively in Domo’s platform and focus less on data hygiene. Data science tools in Magic  ETL including ANOVA, ANCOVA, hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering, K-medians clustering,  logistic regression, multinomial regression, multivariate outliers, nonparametric outliers, OLS  regression, parametric outliers, and time series outliers. Maintaining focused action gets even  easier as Mr. Roboto detects deviations from the norm and automatically alerts users to any  significant irregularity.

## Standardize Best Practices with Extensible Examples

Domo’s AppStore makes it easy to leverage the expertise of Domo’s

partner program and the developer community to personalize Domo

and answer their specific business questions. The AppStore also allows

Domo partners to quickly bring new data-driven solutions to market by

leveraging the time-consuming tasks managed by Domo.

Domo’s full App ecosystem provides hundreds of plug-and-play

dashboards and apps targeted to meet the needs of a specific indus

try, functional role, or use-case scenario. In addition, Domo’s SDK and

Design Studio lets you build your own solution that meets your specific

business needs, while automatically integrating Domo’s native features

like collaboration and alerts.



Build powerful, custom apps that meet your specific business needs, while automatically integrat ing features like collaboration and alerts. Get your hands dirty with a free sandbox environment  to iterate and perfect your solutions. Many are already pre-loaded with sample data, example  cards, and extensive documentation. The API supports programmatic data and user management  so IT can integrate with existing MDM systems, active directories, and security policies.
